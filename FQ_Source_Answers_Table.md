# FQ Source Answers - Cybersecurity Controls

Control ID CCM | Control | User_question | FQ_Source_answer
---|---|---|---
IAM-01 | Identity and Role Management | "How do you manage users, roles, and permissions on the platform?" | We use Supabase Auth with per-tenant roles and JWT claims. Permissions are applied using Row Level Security (RLS) policies in the database.

IAM-03 | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | "Do you have MFA for sensitive access?" | Yes. MFA is enabled for administrative accounts and can be required for users accessing sensitive modules like the RFX area.

IAM-04 | Access Revocation | "How is a user's access revoked (offboarding, role change, etc.)?" | Revocation is done by disabling the account, invalidating active tokens, and updating roles in the database.

IAM-06 | Segregation by Tenant | "How do you guarantee that one client cannot access another's data?" | We use Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables with company_id as the tenant identifier. All 58+ tables have RLS enabled with deny-by-default policies.
IAM-07 | Segregation of Administrative Duties | "Is there segregation between technical and functional administration?" | We implement separate roles: Developer (technical), Platform Admin and Company Admin (functional). However, developers can manage functional admin roles, which we are working to improve.
IAM-08 | Privileged Account Management | "How do you manage accounts with elevated privileges?" | Privileged accounts are minimal and task-specific. MFA is enabled for developer accounts. Access is controlled through RLS policies and stored in separate tables with audit trails (granted_by, granted_at).
DSI-01 | Information Classification | "Do you classify data types (personal, RFX, logs, etc.)?" | Yes. We use a four-tier classification system: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted. Each level has specific security controls (encryption, RLS, access restrictions) documented in our cybersecurity protocol.
DSI-05 | Data Isolation | "How do you prevent unauthorized access to other users' data?" | We implement Row Level Security (RLS) on all 65+ database tables with deny-by-default policies. Access is controlled through security functions that verify user ownership, company membership, and RFX participation.
EKM-03 | Encryption at Rest | "Is the platform data encrypted at rest?" | Yes. All data is encrypted at rest using Supabase's AES-256 encryption with FIPS 140-2 compliant HSMs. Additionally, sensitive data (RFX specs, private keys) uses application-level AES-256-GCM encryption.
EKM-04 | Encryption in Transit | "Is communication between client and server encrypted?" | Yes. All communications use TLS/HTTPS. WebSocket connections use WSS protocol. All Railway-hosted services and Supabase APIs are accessed via encrypted channels.
EKM-05 | Key Management | "How do you manage encryption keys?" | Clients do not manage keys. Master encryption key is stored in Supabase Secrets (server-side only). User private keys are encrypted with the master key via a secure Edge Function. RFX keys are distributed automatically to authorized users.
EKM-06 | Encryption Algorithms and Scheme | "What encryption algorithms do you use to protect data and encryption keys?" | We use AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption and RSA-OAEP 4096-bit for asymmetric encryption. All implementations use standard Web Crypto API and Deno Crypto API with no custom schemes.
DSI-08 | Encryption of Sensitive Data (RFX) | "Are RFXs additionally encrypted?" | Yes. RFXs use a hybrid encryption model: AES-256-GCM for data encryption and RSA-OAEP 4096-bit for key distribution. All sensitive RFX fields and images are encrypted before storage.
IA-01 | Data Usage for Training | "Do you use client data to train AI models?" | No. We have a Data Processing Agreement with OpenAI that explicitly prohibits using Customer Data for training. We only use pre-trained OpenAI models and perform prompt tuning, not model training.
IA-02 | Data Minimization Sent to LLM | "Do you send entire documents or only relevant fragments to the AI model?" | Our RAG pipeline returns only fragment identifiers and metadata. Complete documents are sent when necessary for accurate technical analysis, with size limits (100,000 characters). Product/company evaluations use only relevant columns from database views.
IA-03 | Prompt Injection Prevention | "Do you apply controls to prevent prompt injection or jailbreak attacks?" | We use message structure separation (LangChain SystemMessage/HumanMessage) and store system prompts in Supabase. However, explicit input validation and sanitization mechanisms are not yet fully implemented.
IA-04 | AI Context Isolation by Tenant | "Can the AI mix information from different clients?" | No. We use conversation_id-based isolation with thread-safe ContextVar. All AI context, state, and messages are isolated per conversation with database-level filtering and encryption support.
IA-05 | AI Agent Usage Audit | "Do you log interactions with the agent for auditing?" | Yes. We use Grafana Loki for comprehensive logging. All user inputs, agent responses, tool calls, and connection events are logged with conversation_id tags, timestamps, and structured metadata for complete traceability.
IA-06 | Output Filtering | "Do you apply filters on the responses generated by the AI?" | We rely on system prompts to guide AI behavior, but explicit technical output filtering mechanisms are not yet implemented. Responses are transmitted directly without content validation or moderation.
IA-07 | System Prompt Governance | "Who can modify the behavior of the AI agent (system prompt)?" | Only developers can modify system prompts through the Settings page (frontend and database RLS protected). All changes are versioned with timestamps, user attribution, comments, and restoration capabilities.
IA-08 | AI Risk Assessment | "Have you carried out a specific risk assessment for the use of AI?" | We have implemented multiple AI security controls (IA-02 through IA-06), but a formal, comprehensive AI risk assessment document is not yet available. Risk recognition is implicit through implemented security measures.
SEF-02 | Security Testing | "Do you carry out security tests or periodic pentests?" | Yes. We conduct periodic independent penetration tests. Security testing utilities are integrated into the development process, and we implement multi-layer security controls validated through testing.
SEF-04 | Input Validation | "Do you validate and sanitize user input on the backend?" | We use Pydantic models for structured inputs and parameterized queries for SQL injection protection. However, comprehensive input validation and sanitization following OWASP best practices are not yet fully implemented.
SEF-05 | API Protection | "How do you protect the platform's APIs?" | Edge Functions are protected by JWT authentication or signature verification. Database APIs are protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies. All endpoints require authentication except one low-risk geocoding function.
SEF-06 | Session Management | "How do you manage user sessions and tokens?" | We use Supabase Auth with JWT tokens expiring after 1 hour. Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration. Refresh token rotation is enabled with a 10-second reuse interval. Logout invalidates sessions across all devices.
SEF-07 | CSRF/CORS Protection | "Do you have measures against CSRF and secure CORS configuration?" | We use JWT-based authentication for CSRF protection and configure security headers. However, CORS configuration is inconsistent; most Edge Functions use wildcard (*) while one critical function uses proper origin validation.
SEF-08 | Brute Force Protection | "Do you protect login forms against brute force?" | Yes. We protect login forms against brute force attacks using Supabase Auth's server-side, IP-based rate limiting, allowing 30 sign-in/sign-up requests per 5-minute interval per IP address.
SEF-09 | Perimeter Protection | "Is the application published on the internet protected by a WAF or equivalent service (CDN + perimeter security)?" | Yes. Our application is protected by Vercel's edge network, which provides WAF capabilities, DDoS mitigation, rate limiting, and applies OWASP rules before traffic reaches the origin. Supabase Edge Functions also provide perimeter protection.
LOG-01 | Security Event Logging | "What security events do you log?" | We log connection events, system errors, application exceptions, and all AI agent interactions through Grafana Loki. However, explicit security events like authentication failures and authorization denials are not specifically categorized as security events.
LOG-02 | Log Protection | "Do logs contain sensitive data? How are they protected?" | All logs are stored exclusively in Grafana Loki (no local files). Logs are transmitted via HTTPS with API token authentication. We minimize sensitive data in logs and store them in controlled locations with restricted access.
LOG-03 | Log Retention | "How long do you retain logs?" | Security logs are retained for 1 year, audit logs for 7 years, application error logs for 90 days, and application info logs for 30 days. Automated retention policies manage log lifecycle with archival capabilities.
BCR-01 | Backups and Restoration | "Do you have backups and restoration procedures?" | Yes. Supabase provides automated physical backups with point-in-time recovery. We also have local development backup scripts and application-level backups for RFX specifications and agent configurations.
BCR-02 | Continuity Plan | "Is there a business continuity plan for the platform?" | We have local development backup procedures and database migration versioning, and rely on managed cloud services with built-in backups. However, a formal, documented Business Continuity Plan (BCP) or Disaster Recovery (DR) plan for production is not yet available.
BCR-03 | Restoration Testing | "Do you periodically test restoration from backups?" | We have backup and restoration procedures in place. However, there is no documented evidence of periodic restoration tests being carried out to validate backup effectiveness or a formal testing schedule.
TVM-01 | Vulnerability Management | "How do you manage software vulnerabilities?" | We use npm audit for vulnerability scanning and have manual processes for addressing vulnerabilities. However, automated dependency update workflows and a formal patch management policy are not yet fully systematized.
TVM-02 | Component Updates | "How often do you update third-party libraries and components?" | We actively maintain dependencies using semantic versioning with caret (^) ranges, allowing automatic patch and minor updates. All dependency changes are tracked in version control. Edge Functions use explicit version pinning for security-critical dependencies.
TVM-03 | AI Dependency Management | "Do you review the versions and changes of AI providers?" | Yes. We maintain a proactive policy of always updating to the latest OpenAI models. All AI model versions are centrally managed through a database-driven system, enabling rapid updates without code changes.
OPS-01 | Deployment Security | "How do you manage new version deployments?" | We follow a structured SDLC with version-controlled migrations, automated Vercel deployment for frontend, and Supabase Edge Functions deployment via CLI. All changes are developed and tested locally before production deployment.
OPS-02 | Development and Production Environments | "Do you separate development and production environments?" | Yes. We maintain clear and comprehensive separation between development and production environments across frontend (Vercel), backend (Railway), database (Supabase local vs remote), and Edge Functions, with isolated configurations and URLs.
OPS-03 | Segregation of Duties in Deployments | "Who can deploy to production?" | Currently, a single developer manages deployments, which is appropriate for our size. Deployment access is controlled by platform authentication (Vercel, Supabase, Railway), and all changes are version-controlled. Segregation of duties will be implemented as the team grows.
OPS-04 | Use of Production Data in Test | "Do you use production data in testing environments?" | No. We maintain strict separation, using isolated local databases with synthetic test data from seed files. Optional production data dumping is a manual process, explicitly documented, and excluded from version control.
MON-01 | Availability Monitoring | "Do you monitor service availability?" | Yes. We use Vercel Analytics for web analytics, Supabase infrastructure monitoring, Cloudflare for DDoS protection, and Grafana for log aggregation. Client-side connection status tracking and maintenance mode detection are also implemented.
MON-02 | Security Monitoring | "Do you monitor suspicious events or patterns?" | Yes. We implement comprehensive security monitoring through Vercel Analytics, Cloudflare, Supabase infrastructure monitoring, and Grafana log aggregation. We monitor authentication failures, rate limiting violations, bot detection, and security policy violations.
MON-03 | Automatic Alerts | "Do you have automatic alerts for relevant incidents?" | Yes. We leverage automatic alerts from Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare, and Railway for infrastructure monitoring. Application-level error logging feeds into these monitoring systems. Edge functions log errors for incident detection, and client-side error reporting is implemented.
IVS-01 | Code Review | "Is code reviewed before reaching production?" | Yes. We implement code review through AI-assisted development (Cursor), version control practices, automated ESLint checks, and comprehensive cybersecurity development rules. All code is developed and tested locally before production deployment.
IVS-02 | Static Analysis Tools | "Do you use static analysis tools (SAST) or security linters?" | We use ESLint and TypeScript for code quality and type checking. However, dedicated security-focused SAST tools (e.g., Snyk, SonarQube) and security-specific linting plugins are not yet configured. The existing setup provides a foundation that can be enhanced with security-focused tools.
GOV-01 | Security Policy | "Do you have a formally approved information security policy?" | Yes. We maintain a comprehensive security policy document (.cursor/rules/cybersecurity.mdc) that defines mandatory security standards for all development. It covers cryptographic standards, data classification, RLS requirements, and RFX encryption.
GOV-03 | Third-Party Management | "Do you evaluate the security of the providers you use (e.g., AI, cloud)?" | We use reputable providers (Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare, Railway, OpenAI) with known security certifications. However, there is no documented evidence of formal security evaluation, due diligence processes, or ongoing security assessment procedures for these third-party providers.
PRI-01 | GDPR Compliance | "Do you comply with GDPR in the processing of personal data?" | Yes. We have privacy policy and terms of service publicly available. Users must accept terms before subscribing. We implement data minimization, encryption for PII, and RLS policies. We use DPAs with third-party processors.
PRI-02 | Data Subject Rights | "How do you manage requests for access, rectification, or erasure of data?" | Users can view and modify their data through the profile interface. Data erasure is supported through CASCADE DELETE infrastructure, but a dedicated GDPR request process and data export functionality are not yet implemented.
PRI-04 | Record of Processing Activities | "Do you maintain a Record of Processing Activities (RoPA)?" | Yes. We maintain comprehensive documentation through database schema comments, data classification scheme, terms acceptance tracking, and RLS policies. While there is no single formal RoPA document, these elements together provide a comprehensive record of data processing activities.
GOV-04 | Security Training | "Do personnel receive security training?" | We have comprehensive security documentation and receive cybersecurity guidance from Deloitte. However, a formal, documented security training program with training records, scheduled sessions, and completion tracking is not yet fully established.
GOV-05 | Incident Management | "Do you have a security incident management procedure?" | We have comprehensive incident detection infrastructure (monitoring, logging, error handling) and security event detection. However, a formal documented incident management procedure defining roles, responsibilities, escalation paths, and response workflows is not yet available.
