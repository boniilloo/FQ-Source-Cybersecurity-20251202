**Platform**: FQ Source Web Platform

---

## Executive Summary

This audit evaluates the automatic alert mechanisms implemented in the FQ Source platform for detecting and responding to relevant security incidents and system anomalies.

**Compliance Status**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

The platform implements automatic alerts through multiple layers:
- **External Service Alerts**: Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare, and Railway provide infrastructure-level monitoring and alerting
- **Application-Level Logging**: Comprehensive error logging in Edge Functions with console.error for incident detection
- **Error Reporting System**: Client-side error reporting mechanism for user-reported incidents
- **Security Event Logging**: Suspicious activity detection and logging

**Key Finding**: The platform leverages external service providers' built-in alerting capabilities (Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare, Railway) for infrastructure monitoring, while implementing application-level error logging that feeds into these monitoring systems. This multi-layered approach provides early reaction capability for relevant incidents.

## 3. Application-Level Error Logging and Alerting

The application implements comprehensive error logging that feeds into monitoring systems for incident detection.

### 3.1. Edge Function Error Logging

Edge Functions use structured error logging with `console.error()` which is captured by Supabase's logging infrastructure and can trigger alerts.

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// supabase/functions/crypto-service/index.ts
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  try {
    // ... authentication and processing ...
    
    const masterKeyHex = Deno.env.get("MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY");
    if (!masterKeyHex) {
      console.error("MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY is not set");
      throw new Error("Server configuration error");
    }
    
    // ... encryption/decryption logic ...
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Crypto service error:", error);
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }), {
      status: 400,
      headers: { ...corsHeaders, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    });
  }
});
```

**Edge Functions with Error Logging**:
- `crypto-service` - Logs encryption errors and configuration issues

- `send-admin-notification` - Logs email sending failures
- `send-rfx-review-email` - Logs review email errors

**Alert Integration**:

- Errors can trigger alerts through Supabase monitoring dashboard
- Error logs are aggregated in Grafana for analysis and alerting

### 3.2. Stripe Webhook Error Handling

The Stripe webhook implements comprehensive error logging for payment-related incidents:

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts
async function handler(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  // Log all incoming requests for debugging
  console.log("Request received", {
    method: req.method,
    url: req.url,
    headers: Object.fromEntries(req.headers.entries()),
    hasStripeSignature: !!req.headers.get("stripe-signature"),
  });

  // Verify Stripe signature
  const signature = req.headers.get("stripe-signature");
  if (!signature) {
    console.error("Missing stripe-signature header", {
      allHeaders: Object.fromEntries(req.headers.entries()),
    });
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ error: "Missing stripe-signature header" }), 
      { 
        status: 400,
        headers: { ...corsHeaders, "Content-Type": "application/json" }
      }
    );
  }

  try {
    event = await stripe.webhooks.constructEventAsync(
      rawBody, 
      signature, 
      STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    );
  } catch (err: any) {
    console.error("Webhook signature verification failed:", err?.message);
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ error: `Webhook signature verification failed: ${err?.message}` }), 
      { 
        status: 400, 
        headers: { ...corsHeaders, "Content-Type": "application/json" }
      }
    );
  }

  try {
    // ... process webhook events ...
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error processing webhook:", err);
    return new Response("Error", { status: 500, headers: corsHeaders });
  }
}
```

**Alert Triggers**:
- Webhook signature verification failures (potential security incidents)
- Payment processing errors (business-critical incidents)
- Database operation failures during webhook processing

### 3.3. Admin Notification Error Handling

The admin notification system logs errors for email delivery failures:

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// supabase/functions/send-admin-notification/index.ts
const handler = async (req: Request): Promise<Response> => {
  try {
    console.log('🔍 Edge function started');
    console.log('🔑 RESEND_API_KEY exists:', !!Deno.env.get("RESEND_API_KEY"));
    
    // ... email sending logic ...
    
    console.log("✅ Email sent successfully:", emailResponse);
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ 
      success: true, 
      emailId: emailResponse.data?.id,
      message: `Email sent to ${userEmail}`
    }), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        ...corsHeaders,
      },
    });
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("❌ Error in send-admin-notification function:", error);
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ 
        success: false, 
        error: error.message 
      }),
      {
        status: 500,
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", ...corsHeaders },
      }
    );
  }
};
```

**Alert Triggers**:
- Email delivery failures (notification system failures)
- Missing environment variables (configuration errors)
- Database query failures

## 4. Security Event Detection and Logging

The platform implements security event detection mechanisms that can trigger alerts.

### 4.1. Authentication Failure Detection

**Evidence**:
Edge Functions implement authentication checks that log failures:

```typescript
// supabase/functions/crypto-service/index.ts
const authHeader = req.headers.get("Authorization");
if (!authHeader) {
  throw new Error("Missing Authorization header");
}

const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabaseClient.auth.getUser();

if (!user) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: "Unauthorized" }), {
    status: 401,
    headers: { ...corsHeaders, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  });
}
```

**Alert Integration**:
- Authentication failures are logged by Supabase Auth
- Supabase provides alerts for unusual authentication patterns
- Multiple failed authentication attempts can trigger security alerts

### 4.2. Suspicious Activity Detection

The platform includes anti-scraping mechanisms that log suspicious activity:

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// src/services/antiScrapingService.ts (referenced in codebase)
async logSuspiciousActivity(activity: {
  type: string;
  details: string;
  userAgent?: string;
  ip?: string;
  timestamp?: number;
}): Promise<void> {
  try {
    console.warn('Suspicious activity detected:', activity);
    
    console.log('Security log entry:', {
      type: activity.type,
      details: activity.details,
      user_agent: activity.userAgent || navigator.userAgent,
      ip_address: activity.ip || this.getClientIP(),
      timestamp: activity.timestamp || Date.now(),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error logging suspicious activity:', error);
  }
}
```

**Alert Integration**:
- Suspicious activity logs are captured by client-side logging
- Can be integrated with monitoring systems for alert generation
- Security events can trigger automated responses

### 4.3. Encryption Key Errors

The platform logs critical errors related to encryption key management:

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// supabase/functions/crypto-service/index.ts
const masterKeyHex = Deno.env.get("MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY");
if (!masterKeyHex) {
  console.error("MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY is not set");
  throw new Error("Server configuration error");
}
```

**Alert Triggers**:
- Missing encryption keys (critical security configuration errors)
- Encryption/decryption failures (data integrity issues)
- Key generation failures (security service degradation)

---

## 5. Error Reporting System

The platform includes a client-side error reporting mechanism for user-reported incidents.

### 5.1. Error Report Tracking
