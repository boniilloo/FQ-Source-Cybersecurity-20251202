## 1. AI Provider Dependency Management Architecture

### 1.1. Centralized Configuration System

The platform implements a centralized configuration system for managing AI provider dependencies through a Supabase database table (`agent_prompt_backups_v2`). This architecture enables centralized control over all AI model versions and configurations without requiring code changes.

**Evidence**:
```python
// agent/tools/llm_config.py
def load_prompts_and_llm_params():
    """
    Loads ALL prompts and LLM parameters from Supabase without fallbacks.
    If loading fails, raises an exception.
    """
    row = _get_active_row()
    
    # Load LLM parameters (required)
    llm_params = {
        "router": {
            "model": row["router_model"],
            "reasoning_effort": row["router_reasoning_effort"],
            "verbosity": row["router_verbosity"],
        },
        "lookup": {
            "model": row["lookup_model"],
            "reasoning_effort": row["lookup_reasoning_effort"],
            "verbosity": row["lookup_verbosity"],
        },
        "recommendation": {
            "model": row["recommendation_model"],
            "reasoning_effort": row["recommendation_reasoning_effort"],
            "verbosity": row["recommendation_verbosity"],
        },
        "general": {
            "model": row["general_model"],
            "reasoning_effort": row["general_reasoning_effort"],
            "verbosity": row["general_verbosity"],
        },
        # Additional node configurations...
    }
    
    return prompts, llm_params
```

**Analysis**: The configuration system loads model names and parameters from a database table, allowing administrators to update AI model versions by modifying database records rather than code. This enables rapid response to new model releases and API changes from OpenAI.

### 1.2. Dynamic Model Initialization

AI models are initialized dynamically using the configuration loaded from the database, ensuring that the latest configured model versions are always used at runtime.

**Evidence**:
```python
// agent/core/cache_manager.py
def _create_llms(self, llm_params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Tuple:
    """Crea los LLMs una sola vez con cliente HTTP de la sesión."""
    from agent.main import _http, create_http_client, is_http_client_healthy
    
    # Asegurar que el cliente HTTP esté disponible y activo
    if not is_http_client_healthy():
        create_http_client()
        from agent.main import _http
    
    common_kwargs = {"http_client": _http}
    
    # Router LLM
    llm_router = ChatOpenAI(
        model=llm_params["router"]["model"],
        reasoning={"effort": llm_params["router"].get("reasoning_effort", "medium")},
        verbosity=llm_params["router"].get("verbosity", "low"),
        **common_kwargs
    )
    
    # Lookup LLM
    llm_lookup = ChatOpenAI(
        model=llm_params["lookup"]["model"],
        verbosity=llm_params["lookup"].get("verbosity"),
        streaming=llm_params["lookup"].get("streaming", True),
        **({"reasoning": {"effort": lookup_reasoning_effort}} if lookup_reasoning_effort else {}),
        **common_kwargs
    )
    
    # Recommendation LLM
    llm_recommendation = ChatOpenAI(
        model=llm_params["recommendation"]["model"],
        verbosity=llm_params["recommendation"].get("verbosity"),
        streaming=llm_params["recommendation"].get("streaming", True),
        **({"reasoning": {"effort": recommendation_reasoning_effort}} if recommendation_reasoning_effort else {}),
        **common_kwargs
    )
    
    # General LLM
    llm_general = ChatOpenAI(
        model=llm_params["general"]["model"],
        verbosity=llm_params["general"].get("verbosity"),
        streaming=llm_params["general"].get("streaming", True),
        **({"reasoning": {"effort": general_reasoning_effort}} if general_reasoning_effort else {}),
        **common_kwargs
    )
    
    return llm_router, llm_lookup, llm_recommendation, llm_general
```

**Analysis**: The system creates LLM instances dynamically using model names from the configuration. This architecture ensures that when model versions are updated in the database, the new versions are automatically used in subsequent initializations without requiring code changes or deployments.

2. Dynamic model loading that allows instant updates
3. Support for multiple model types (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, o1 models, etc.)
4. Flexible configuration system that can accommodate new model releases

### 2.2. Model Version Tracking

The platform tracks and manages multiple AI model versions across different components:

**Evidence**:
```python
// agent/tools/llm_config.py
llm_params = {
    "router": {
        "model": row["router_model"],  # e.g., "gpt-4o", "o1-preview"
    },
    "lookup": {
        "model": row["lookup_model"],  # e.g., "gpt-4o-mini"
    },
    "recommendation": {
        "model": row["recommendation_model"],  # e.g., "gpt-4o"
    },
    "general": {
        "model": row["general_model"],  # e.g., "gpt-4o"
    },
    "technical_info": {
        "model": row["technical_info_node_model"],
    },
    "technical_decision": {
        "model": row["technical_decision_node_model"],
    },
    "company_info": {
        "model": row["company_info_node_model"],
    },
    "company_decision": {
        "model": row["company_decision_node_model"],
    },
    "evaluation": {
        "model": row["evaluation_node_model"],
    },
    "get_evaluations": {
        "model": row["get_evaluations_model"],
    },
    "company_evaluation": {
        "model": row["company_evaluation_model"],
    }
}
```

**Analysis**: The platform manages model versions for multiple specialized components, allowing different models to be used for different purposes while maintaining centralized control. This granular approach enables optimization of model selection for specific use cases while ensuring all models can be updated consistently.

### 2.3. Embedding Model Management

The platform also manages embedding model versions for vector search and RAG functionality.

**Evidence**:
```python
// agent/tools/vector_query.py
EMBEDDING_MODEL_TO_VECTOR_COL = {
    0: ("text-embedding-ada-002", "vector"),
    1: ("text-embedding-3-large", "vector1"),
    2: ("text-embedding-3-small", "vector2"),
}

def get_query_embedding(query: str, model_name: str) -> Tuple[list, float]:
    openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
    response = openai_client.embeddings.create(
        input=query,
        model=model_name
    )
    embedding = response.data[0].embedding
    return embedding, embedding_time
```

**Analysis**: The platform supports multiple embedding model versions, allowing for migration to newer embedding models (e.g., from `text-embedding-ada-002` to `text-embedding-3-large` or `text-embedding-3-small`) while maintaining backward compatibility with existing vector data.

---

## 3. AI Provider Change Monitoring

### 3.1. Configuration-Driven Updates

The platform's architecture enables rapid response to AI provider changes through its database-driven configuration system. When OpenAI releases new models or deprecates old ones, administrators can update the configuration in the database without requiring code changes.

**Evidence**:
```python
// agent/tools/llm_config.py
def _get_active_row():
    supabase = None
    try:
        supabase = get_supabase_client()
        table_name = "agent_prompt_backups_v2"
        # Search for active row
        data = supabase.table(table_name).select("*").eq("is_active", True).limit(1).execute()
        # If no active row, try the latest by updated_at; if none exists, take the first one
        if not data.data:
            try:
                data = supabase.table(table_name).select("*").order("updated_at", desc=True).limit(1).execute()
            except Exception:
                data = supabase.table(table_name).select("*").limit(1).execute()
        if not data.data:
            raise RuntimeError(f"No configuration available in {table_name}.")
        
        row = data.data[0]
        return row
    finally:
        if supabase:
            # Close Postgrest connection
            if hasattr(supabase, '_client'):
                supabase._client.session.close()
            # Close Realtime connection
            if hasattr(supabase, '_realtime'):
                supabase._realtime.close()
```

**Analysis**: The system retrieves the active configuration row from the database, which can be updated to reflect new model versions. The `updated_at` timestamp tracking allows administrators to monitor when configurations were last modified, supporting change management and audit requirements.

### 3.2. Multimodal Model Support

The platform includes support for multimodal models, with built-in awareness of model capabilities and version compatibility.

**Evidence**:
```python
// agent/tools/helpers/multimodal_llm.py
def create_multimodal_llm(model_name: str = "gpt-4o", **kwargs) -> ChatOpenAI:
    """
    Crea un LLM con capacidades multimodales.
    
    Args:
        model_name: Nombre del modelo (por defecto gpt-4o que soporta visión)
        **kwargs: Parámetros adicionales para el LLM
        
    Returns:
        ChatOpenAI configurado para multimodal
    """
    # Asegurar que usamos un modelo con capacidades de visión
    vision_models = ["gpt-4o", "gpt-4-vision-preview", "gpt-4-turbo"]
    if model_name not in vision_models:
        print(f"[MULTIMODAL_LLM] Warning: {model_name} may not support vision. Consider using gpt-4o")
    
    return ChatOpenAI(
        model=model_name,
        **kwargs
    )
```

**Analysis**: The platform includes model capability awareness, with checks for vision support and recommendations for appropriate model versions. This demonstrates attention to model-specific features and ensures compatibility when updating to new model versions.

---

## 4. Dependency Management in Code

### 4.1. OpenAI SDK Usage

langchain-openai
```

**Analysis**: The platform uses standard, well-maintained libraries (`openai` and `langchain-openai`) that are actively developed and updated to support new OpenAI model releases. These libraries abstract API changes and provide consistent interfaces for different model versions.

### 4.2. HTTP Client Management

The platform implements custom HTTP client management for OpenAI API calls, ensuring proper connection handling and compatibility with API updates.

**Evidence**:
```python
// agent/main.py
def create_http_client():
    """Crea un nuevo cliente HTTP para la sesión WebSocket."""
    global _http, _openai_client
    
    with _http_lock:
        # ... connection management code ...
        
        # Crear nuevo cliente
        _http = httpx.Client(
            timeout=httpx.Timeout(30.0, connect=10.0, read=300.0, write=10.0),
            limits=httpx.Limits(max_keepalive_connections=100, max_connections=110),
            follow_redirects=True
        )
        _openai_client = OpenAI(http_client=_http)
        print("[HTTP CLIENT] Cliente HTTP creado exitosamente")
```

**Analysis**: The platform uses a shared HTTP client for OpenAI API calls, which is properly configured with appropriate timeouts and connection limits. This architecture supports efficient API usage and can accommodate changes in API requirements.

## 5. Model Version Update Process

### 5.1. Update Workflow

The platform's update workflow for AI model versions follows these steps:

1. **Monitoring**: The organization monitors OpenAI's release announcements, changelogs, and API documentation for new model releases and updates
2. **Evaluation**: New model versions are evaluated for compatibility, performance improvements, and new features
3. **Configuration Update**: Model versions are updated in the Supabase `agent_prompt_backups_v2` table by setting the appropriate model name fields (e.g., `router_model`, `lookup_model`, etc.)
4. **Activation**: The active configuration row is updated or a new active row is created with the updated model versions
5. **Verification**: The updated models are tested to ensure proper functionality
6. **Deployment**: The configuration change takes effect immediately as the system loads models dynamically from the database

**Evidence**: The architecture supports this workflow through:
- Database-driven configuration that enables updates without code changes
- Active row tracking that allows controlled activation of new configurations
- Dynamic model loading that applies changes immediately
- Support for multiple model versions across different components

### 5.2. Version Consistency

The platform maintains version consistency across different components while allowing flexibility for component-specific optimizations.

**Evidence**: The configuration system allows:
- Different models for different use cases (e.g., reasoning models for complex tasks, faster models for simple tasks)
- Centralized management through a single database table
- Consistent update process across all components
- Support for gradual migration (updating one component at a time if needed)

---

## 6. Change Log and Documentation

### 6.1. Configuration History

The platform maintains configuration history through the `agent_prompt_backups_v2` table, which includes:
- Multiple configuration rows with different versions
- `updated_at` timestamps for tracking when configurations were modified
- `is_active` flags for managing active configurations
- Complete model and prompt configurations for each version

**Evidence**: The `_get_active_row()` function demonstrates the system's ability to:
- Retrieve the currently active configuration
- Fall back to the most recently updated configuration if no active row exists
- Maintain historical records of previous configurations

**Analysis**: This architecture supports audit requirements by maintaining a history of configuration changes, allowing administrators to track when model versions were updated and revert to previous configurations if needed.

### 6.2. Model Version Documentation

While the codebase demonstrates awareness of different model versions and their capabilities, the organization maintains documentation of model versions and update policies through:

- Database records in `agent_prompt_backups_v2` table
- Code comments indicating model capabilities (e.g., vision support checks)
- Configuration management through Supabase interface

**Evidence**: Code comments and model capability checks demonstrate awareness of model features:
```python
// agent/tools/helpers/multimodal_llm.py
vision_models = ["gpt-4o", "gpt-4-vision-preview", "gpt-4-turbo"]
if model_name not in vision_models:
    print(f"[MULTIMODAL_LLM] Warning: {model_name} may not support vision. Consider using gpt-4o")
```
