# Script para hacer backup y restore de la base de datos local
# Uso: ./scripts/backup-and-restore-local-db.sh [backup|restore]

ACTION=${1:-backup}
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="supabase/local_db_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql"

if [ "$ACTION" = "backup" ]; then
    echo "Haciendo backup de la base de datos local..."
    supabase db dump --local --data-only -f "$BACKUP_FILE"
    echo "✅ Backup guardado en: $BACKUP_FILE"
    echo "💡 Para restaurar: ./scripts/backup-and-restore-local-db.sh restore $BACKUP_FILE"
elif [ "$ACTION" = "restore" ]; then
    RESTORE_FILE=${2:-$BACKUP_FILE}
    if [ ! -f "$RESTORE_FILE" ]; then
        echo "❌ Error: Archivo de backup no encontrado: $RESTORE_FILE"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "Restaurando datos desde: $RESTORE_FILE"
    psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres -f "$RESTORE_FILE"
    echo "✅ Datos restaurados"
else
    echo "Uso: $0 [backup|restore] [archivo_backup]"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Automated Restoration Script**:
```bash
// scripts/reset-with-data-preservation.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Script para hacer reset preservando datos
# Uso: ./scripts/reset-with-data-preservation.sh

echo "🔄 Haciendo backup de datos antes del reset..."
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="supabase/local_db_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql"

# Hacer backup de los datos
supabase db dump --local --data-only -f "$BACKUP_FILE"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Backup guardado en: $BACKUP_FILE"
    echo "🔄 Haciendo reset de la base de datos..."
    
    # Hacer reset
    supabase db reset
    
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ Reset completado"
        echo "🔄 Restaurando datos..."
        
        # Restaurar datos
        psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres -f "$BACKUP_FILE"
        
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "✅ Datos restaurados exitosamente"
        else
            echo "❌ Error al restaurar datos"
            exit 1
        fi
    else
        echo "❌ Error al hacer reset"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "❌ Error al hacer backup"

✅ **Restoration Capabilities Exist**: Both production and development environments have documented restoration procedures and working restoration mechanisms in place.

✅ **Local Development Testing**: Local development workflows include restoration operations (via `reset-with-data-preservation.sh`), demonstrating that restoration mechanisms work in practice during normal development.

✅ **Managed Service Reliability**: Production backups are managed by Supabase, which conducts its own backup verification and testing at the infrastructure level.

✅ **Documentation of Procedures**: Local backup and restoration procedures are well-documented in `docs/LOCAL_DB_DATA_PRESERVATION.md`, providing clear guidance for developers.

### 7.2. Recommendations

1. **Implement Periodic Restoration Testing Schedule**: Establish and document a regular schedule for conducting restoration tests (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually) for both production and development backups.

2. **Create Restoration Testing Procedures**: Develop comprehensive documentation for restoration testing procedures, including test scenarios, validation criteria, and success criteria for different types of restoration tests.

3. **Establish Restoration Test Logging**: Implement a formal process for logging restoration tests, including test dates, backup sources tested, test results, issues discovered, resolutions, and validation outcomes.

4. **Conduct Production Backup Restoration Tests**: Perform periodic restoration tests using Supabase backups in a test environment to validate that production backups can be successfully restored in practice.

5. **Validate Backup Completeness**: Develop procedures to validate backup completeness after restoration, including data integrity checks, schema validation, and application functionality verification.

6. **Document Test Results**: Maintain formal documentation of all restoration test results, including both successful tests and any issues discovered, to demonstrate ongoing validation of backup effectiveness.

7. **Implement Test Scenarios**: Create and document various test scenarios including full database restoration, partial restoration, point-in-time recovery, and disaster recovery scenarios.

## 8. Control Compliance

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----|
| Backup procedures exist | ✅ COMPLIANT | Production backups via Supabase, local backup scripts documented |
| Restoration procedures exist | ✅ COMPLIANT | Documented restoration procedures for local development; Supabase provides production restoration capabilities |
| Restoration test logs exist | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No restoration test logs found in codebase or documentation |
| Periodic restoration tests are carried out | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No evidence of periodic restoration testing schedule or test execution |
| Restoration tests validate backup effectiveness | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented test procedures or results demonstrating backup validation |
| Testing documented in practice | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documentation or logs showing backups have been tested in practice |

**FINAL VERDICT**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT** with control BCR-03. The platform has comprehensive backup and restoration procedures in place at multiple levels, with documented restoration capabilities for both production and development environments. However, there is no evidence that periodic restoration tests are being carried out to validate the effectiveness of the backups. No restoration test logs exist, no periodic testing schedule is documented, and there is no evidence of restoration testing being performed in practice. While the platform relies on Supabase's managed backup testing for production infrastructure, there are no platform-initiated restoration tests to validate that backups can be successfully restored in practice. To achieve full compliance, the platform should implement a periodic restoration testing program with documented procedures, regular test execution, and comprehensive test logging.
