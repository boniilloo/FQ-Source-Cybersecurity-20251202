## 2. Security Testing Practices

### 2.1. Automated Security Testing Utilities

The platform includes security testing utilities for validating security controls:

**Anti-Scraping Testing**:
```typescript
// src/utils/testAntiScraping.ts
export const testAntiScrapingMeasures = () => {
  // Test 1: Text obfuscation
  // Test 2: Scraping pattern detection
  // Test 3: Known scraper detection
  // Test 4: Fake data generation
  // Test 5: Rate limiting
  // Test 6: Bot detection
};
```

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// src/utils/testAntiScraping.ts
export const testAntiScrapingMeasures = () => {
  console.log('🧪 Testing Anti-Scraping Measures...\n');

  // Test 1: Obfuscación de texto
  console.log('1. Testing Text Obfuscation:');
  const originalText = 'Hello World';
  const obfuscated = obfuscateText(originalText);
  const deobfuscated = deobfuscateText(obfuscated);
  
  console.log(`   Original: ${originalText}`);
  console.log(`   Obfuscated: ${obfuscated}`);
  console.log(`   Deobfuscated: ${deobfuscated}`);
  console.log(`   ✅ Match: ${originalText === deobfuscated}\n`);

  // Test 2: Detección de patrones de scraping
  console.log('2. Testing Scraping Pattern Detection:');
  const suspiciousUrls = [
    'https://example.com?page=1',
    'https://example.com?offset=10&limit=20',
    // ... more test cases
  ];
  
  suspiciousUrls.forEach(url => {
    const isSuspicious = detectScrapingPatterns(url);
    console.log(`   ${url}: ${isSuspicious ? '🚨 Suspicious' : '✅ Normal'}`);
  });
  // ... additional test cases
};
```

### 2.2. Input Validation and Sanitization Testing

The platform implements comprehensive input validation and sanitization that can be tested:

**Security Utilities**:
```typescript
// src/lib/security.ts
export function sanitizeText(input: string, maxLength: number = 1000): string {
  if (!input || typeof input !== 'string') {
    return '';
  }
  
  // Remove HTML tags and entities
  const sanitized = input
    .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
    .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
    .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
    .replace(/'/g, '&#x27;')
    .replace(/\//g, '&#x2F;')
    .trim();
  
  // Limit length
  return sanitized.slice(0, maxLength);
}
```

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// src/lib/security.ts
/**
 * Security utilities for input validation and sanitization
 */

// Input validation schemas
export const ValidationRules = {
  // Email validation
  email: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/,
  
  // Text input validation (prevent XSS)
  text: {
    maxLength: 1000,
    minLength: 1,
    pattern: /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_.,!?()]+$/
  },
  
  // Company name validation
  companyName: {
    maxLength: 100,
    minLength: 2,
    pattern: /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-_.,&()]+$/
  },
  
  // URL validation
  // ...
};

/**
 * Sanitize text input to prevent XSS attacks
 */
export function sanitizeText(input: string, maxLength: number = 1000): string {
  if (!input || typeof input !== 'string') {
    return '';
  }
  
  // Remove HTML tags and entities
  const sanitized = input
    .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
    .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
    .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
    .replace(/'/g, '&#x27;')
    .replace(/\//g, '&#x2F;')
    .trim();
  
  // Limit length
  return sanitized.slice(0, maxLength);
}
```

### 2.3. Secure Input Components

The platform includes secure input components with built-in validation and sanitization:

**Evidence**:
```typescript
// src/components/ui/SecureInput.tsx
import { sanitizeText, sanitizeUrl, validateText, validateEmail, validateCompanyName, validateUrl, validateLinkedInUrl } from "@/lib/security";

export const SecureInput = React.forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, SecureInputProps>(
  ({ 
    validationType = 'text', 
    maxLength = 1000, 
    sanitize = true,
    // ...
  }, ref) => {
    const handleChange = React.useCallback((e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
      let value = e.target.value;

      // Sanitize input if enabled
      if (sanitize) {
        // Use URL sanitization for URL and LinkedIn inputs to preserve forward slashes
        if (validationType === 'url' || validationType === 'linkedin') {
          value = sanitizeUrl(value, maxLength);
        } else {
          value = sanitizeText(value, maxLength);
        }
        e.target.value = value;
      }

      // Validate on change
      validateInput(value);

      onChange?.(e);
    }, [onChange, sanitize, maxLength, validationType, validateInput]);
    // ...
  }
);
```
