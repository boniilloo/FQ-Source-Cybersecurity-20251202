## Control Information

- **Control ID**: BCR-02
- **Control Name**: Continuity Plan
- **Audit Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Client Question**: "Is there a business continuity plan for the platform?"

---

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE**: The platform demonstrates some continuity planning through local development backup procedures, database migration versioning, and reliance on managed cloud services with built-in backup capabilities. However, there is no formal, documented Business Continuity Plan (BCP) or Disaster Recovery (DR) plan that defines recovery objectives, procedures, roles, and responsibilities for production incidents.

1. **Local Development Backups** - Automated scripts exist for local database backup and restore operations
2. **Database Versioning** - Migration system provides schema versioning and rollback capabilities
3. **Managed Service Backups** - Reliance on Supabase managed service which includes automated backups
4. **Missing Formal Documentation** - No documented BCP/DR plan, RTO/RPO targets, incident response procedures, or backup retention policies
5. **No Production DR Procedures** - No documented procedures for production disaster recovery scenarios

---

## 1. Local Development Backup Procedures

The platform implements backup and restore procedures for local development environments, demonstrating awareness of data preservation needs.

### 1.1. Backup Scripts

The platform includes automated scripts for backing up and restoring local database data:

**Scripts Available**:
- `scripts/backup-and-restore-local-db.sh` - Manual backup and restore operations
- `scripts/reset-with-data-preservation.sh` - Automated reset with data preservation
- `scripts/dump-local-seed.sh` - Generate seed files from local database

**Evidence**:
```bash
// scripts/backup-and-restore-local-db.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Script para hacer backup y restore de la base de datos local
# Uso: ./scripts/backup-and-restore-local-db.sh [backup|restore]

ACTION=${1:-backup}
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="supabase/local_db_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql"

if [ "$ACTION" = "backup" ]; then
    echo "Haciendo backup de la base de datos local..."
    supabase db dump --local --data-only -f "$BACKUP_FILE"
    echo "✅ Backup guardado en: $BACKUP_FILE"
elif [ "$ACTION" = "restore" ]; then
    RESTORE_FILE=${2:-$BACKUP_FILE}
    if [ ! -f "$RESTORE_FILE" ]; then
        echo "❌ Error: Archivo de backup no encontrado: $RESTORE_FILE"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "Restaurando datos desde: $RESTORE_FILE"
    psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres -f "$RESTORE_FILE"
    echo "✅ Datos restaurados"
fi
```

### 1.2. Automated Data Preservation

The platform includes an automated script that preserves data during database resets:

**Evidence**:
```bash
// scripts/reset-with-data-preservation.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Script para hacer reset preservando datos
# Uso: ./scripts/reset-with-data-preservation.sh

echo "🔄 Haciendo backup de datos antes del reset..."
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="supabase/local_db_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql"

# Hacer backup de los datos
supabase db dump --local --data-only -f "$BACKUP_FILE"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Backup guardado en: $BACKUP_FILE"
    echo "🔄 Haciendo reset de la base de datos..."
    
    # Hacer reset
    supabase db reset
    
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ Reset completado"
        echo "🔄 Restaurando datos..."
        
        # Restaurar datos
        psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres -f "$BACKUP_FILE"
        
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            echo "✅ Datos restaurados exitosamente"
        else
            echo "❌ Error al restaurar datos"
            exit 1
        fi
    else
        echo "❌ Error al hacer reset"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "❌ Error al hacer backup"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 1.3. Seed File System

The platform uses a seed file system for data preservation during development:

**Configuration**:
```toml
// supabase/config.toml
[db.seed]
# If enabled, seeds the database after migrations during a db reset.
enabled = true
# Specifies an ordered list of seed files to load during db reset.
# Supports glob patterns relative to supabase directory: "./seeds/*.sql"
sql_paths = ["./seed.sql"]
```

**Documentation**:
```markdown
// docs/LOCAL_DB_DATA_PRESERVATION.md
### Opción 1: Seed File (Recomendado para desarrollo) ⭐

**Cómo funciona:**
- Crea un archivo `supabase/seed.sql` con los datos que quieres conservar
- Este archivo se ejecuta **automáticamente** después de cada `db reset`
- Está configurado en `supabase/config.toml`

**Ventajas:**
- ✅ Automático - no necesitas recordar hacer backup/restore
- ✅ Versionable (si lo quitas del .gitignore)
- ✅ Perfecto para datos de prueba/desarrollo
```

---

## 2. Database Migration and Versioning

The platform implements a formal database migration system that provides schema versioning and rollback capabilities.

### 2.1. Migration System

**Provider**: Supabase CLI migration system

**Location**: `supabase/migrations/`

**Features**:
- Versioned schema changes
- Automatic migration tracking
- Rollback capabilities through migration history

**Evidence**:
The platform maintains a structured migration directory with timestamped migration files:
- `supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20251125173210_get_developer_public_keys.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/20251126091433_update_cancel_rfx_invitation_delete_keys.sql`
- And additional migration files for schema evolution

**Configuration**:
```toml
// supabase/config.toml
[db.migrations]
# If disabled, migrations will be skipped during a db push or reset.
enabled = true
# Specifies an ordered list of schema files that describe your database.
# Supports glob patterns relative to supabase directory: "./schemas/*.sql"
schema_paths = []
```

### 2.2. Migration Backup

The platform maintains backup copies of migrations:

**Evidence**:
- `supabase/migrations_backup_20251121_131748/` - Backup directory with 165 SQL files
- `supabase/migrations_old_20251121_132118/` - Archive directory with 165 SQL files

This demonstrates awareness of the importance of preserving migration history for recovery purposes.

## 8. Control Compliance

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----|
| Existence of backup procedures | ✅ COMPLIANT | Local backup scripts, Supabase automated backups |
| Database versioning and rollback | ✅ COMPLIANT | Migration system with versioned schema changes |
| Infrastructure redundancy | ✅ COMPLIANT | Managed services with built-in redundancy |
| Formal BCP document | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented Business Continuity Plan |
| Documented DR procedures | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented Disaster Recovery procedures |
| Defined RTO/RPO targets | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented recovery objectives |
| Incident response procedures | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented incident response plan |
| Backup testing procedures | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented backup testing schedule |
| Production backup documentation | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Relies on managed service but no explicit documentation |

**FINAL VERDICT**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT** with control BCR-02. The platform demonstrates continuity awareness through local backup procedures, database versioning, and reliance on managed services with built-in backup capabilities. However, there is no formal, documented Business Continuity Plan or Disaster Recovery Plan that defines recovery objectives, procedures, roles, and responsibilities for production incidents. To achieve full compliance, the platform should develop comprehensive BCP/DR documentation that addresses all identified gaps.
