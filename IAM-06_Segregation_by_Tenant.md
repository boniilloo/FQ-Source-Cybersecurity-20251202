# Cybersecurity Audit Report - IAM-06: Segregation by Tenant

**Control ID**: IAM-06  
**Control Name**: Segregation by Tenant  
**Audit Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Auditor**: FQ Source Security Audit  
**Platform**: FQ-V1 Web Platform

---

## Executive Summary

This audit evaluates the platform's implementation of tenant segregation to ensure that one client cannot access another client's data. The platform implements multi-tenancy using **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in Supabase PostgreSQL, with `company_id` serving as the primary tenant identifier.

**Compliance Status**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

The platform demonstrates strong tenant isolation through:
- Comprehensive RLS policies on all tables (58+ tables)
- Consistent use of `company_id` as tenant identifier
- Security definer functions for access control
- Multi-layered access checks for RFX (Request for Exchange) data
- Proper isolation of company-scoped resources

---

## 1. Tenant Identification Architecture

### 1.1. Tenant Identifier

The platform uses **`company_id`** (UUID) as the primary tenant identifier throughout the database schema.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "public"."app_user" (
    "id" "uuid" DEFAULT "gen_random_uuid"() NOT NULL,
    "name" "text",
    "surname" "text",
    "company_id" "uuid",  -- Tenant identifier
    "is_admin" boolean DEFAULT false,
    "is_verified" boolean DEFAULT false,
    "auth_user_id" "uuid",
    "company_position" "text",
    "avatar_url" "text"
);
```

**Key Points**:
- Each user is associated with a `company_id` in the `app_user` table
- The `company_id` references the `company` table, establishing the tenant boundary
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity

### 1.2. Company Table Structure

The `company` table serves as the root tenant entity:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "public"."company" (
    "id" "uuid" DEFAULT "gen_random_uuid"() NOT NULL,
    "url_root" "text" NOT NULL,
    "role" "text" NOT NULL,
    "created_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT "now"(),
    -- ... additional fields
    CONSTRAINT "company_role_check" CHECK (("role" = ANY (ARRAY['supplier'::"text", 'buyer'::"text"])))
);
```

---

## 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation

### 2.1. RLS Coverage

**All tables in the public schema have RLS enabled**, ensuring that data access is controlled at the database level regardless of application-layer logic.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
ALTER TABLE "public"."app_user" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."company" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."company_admin_requests" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."company_billing_info" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."company_revision" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."product" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."rfxs" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."rfx_company_invitations" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... 50+ additional tables with RLS enabled
```

**Total Tables with RLS**: 58+ tables confirmed

### 2.2. RLS Policy Enforcement Strategy

The platform follows a **deny-by-default** approach:
- RLS is enabled on all tables
- Policies explicitly grant access based on tenant membership
- No default permissive policies that would allow cross-tenant access

---

## 3. Company-Scoped Data Isolation

### 3.1. Company Admin Access Control

The platform uses a security definer function `is_approved_company_admin()` to verify company membership:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_approved_company_admin"(
    "p_company_id" "uuid", 
    "p_user_id" "uuid" DEFAULT "auth"."uid"()
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    SET "search_path" TO 'public'
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM company_admin_requests 
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id 
    AND company_id = p_company_id
    AND status = 'approved'
  );
$$;
```

**Usage in RLS Policies**:
```sql
-- Example: Company billing info isolation
CREATE POLICY "company_billing_info_select_for_company_admins" 
    ON "public"."company_billing_info" 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING ("public"."is_approved_company_admin"("company_id"));
```

### 3.2. Company Revision Isolation

Company revisions are isolated by `company_id` with policies that check company admin status:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Approved company admins can view all their company revisions" 
    ON "public"."company_revision" 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING ((EXISTS ( 
        SELECT 1 
        FROM "public"."company_admin_requests" "car"
        WHERE (("car"."company_id" = "company_revision"."company_id") 
            AND ("car"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()) 
            AND ("car"."status" = 'approved'::"text"))
    )));
```

### 3.3. Product Isolation

Products are isolated by company ownership:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Approved company admins can manage their company products" 
    ON "public"."product" 
    USING ((EXISTS ( 
        SELECT 1 
        FROM "public"."company_admin_requests" "car"
        WHERE (("car"."company_id" = "product"."company_id") 
            AND ("car"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()) 
            AND ("car"."status" = 'approved'::"text"))
    )));
```

### 3.4. Notification Events Isolation

Notifications are scoped by company membership:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- fix_notifications_rls_immediate.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view applicable notifications"
  ON public.notification_events
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    -- Company-wide notifications where the current user belongs to the company
    (scope = 'company' AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM public.app_user au_company
      WHERE au_company.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
        AND au_company.company_id = notification_events.company_id
    ))
    OR
    -- Company admins approved via company_admin_requests
    (scope = 'company' AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM public.company_admin_requests car
      WHERE car.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND car.company_id = notification_events.company_id
        AND car.status = 'approved'
    ))
  );
```

---

## 4. RFX (Request for Exchange) Data Isolation

RFX data requires special handling as it involves multi-party collaboration between buyers and suppliers. The platform implements layered access control.

### 4.1. RFX Ownership and Membership

RFX records are isolated by owner (`user_id`) and explicit membership:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own RFXs" 
    ON "public"."rfxs" 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view RFXs they are members of" 
    ON "public"."rfxs" 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING ((EXISTS ( 
        SELECT 1 
        FROM "public"."rfx_members" "m"
        WHERE (("m"."rfx_id" = "rfxs"."id") 
            AND ("m"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()))
    )));
```

### 4.2. RFX Participant Function

A security definer function `is_rfx_participant()` checks if a user is an owner or member:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_rfx_participant"(
    "p_rfx_id" "uuid", 
    "p_user_id" "uuid"
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    AS $$
  -- Check if user is owner of RFX
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfxs
    WHERE id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  )
  OR
  -- Or if user is a member
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfx_members
    WHERE rfx_id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  );
$$;
```

**Usage Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "RFX participants can view NDA metadata" 
    ON "public"."rfx_nda_uploads" 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING ("public"."is_rfx_participant"("rfx_id", "auth"."uid"()));
```

### 4.3. RFX Company Invitations

Suppliers access RFX data through company invitations, which enforce company-level isolation:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Suppliers can view RFX specs with active invitation" 
    ON "public"."rfx_specs" 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING ((EXISTS ( 
        SELECT 1 
        FROM ("public"."rfx_company_invitations" "rci"
            JOIN "public"."company_admin_requests" "car" 
                ON ((("car"."company_id" = "rci"."company_id") 
                    AND ("car"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()) 
                    AND ("car"."status" = 'approved'::"text"))))
        WHERE (("rci"."rfx_id" = "rfx_specs"."rfx_id") 
            AND ("rci"."status" = ANY (ARRAY['supplier evaluating RFX'::"text", 'submitted'::"text"])))
    )));
```

**Key Isolation Mechanism**:
- Suppliers can only access RFX data if their `company_id` matches the invitation's `company_id`
- Access is further restricted by invitation status
- Company membership is verified via `company_admin_requests`

### 4.4. RFX Company Keys Isolation

Encrypted RFX keys are isolated by company:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251126111326_create_rfx_company_keys_table.sql
CREATE POLICY "Companies can view their own keys" 
    ON "public"."rfx_company_keys"
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM "public"."app_user" "au"
            WHERE "au"."company_id" = "rfx_company_keys"."company_id"
            AND "au"."auth_user_id" = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

---

## 5. Cross-Tenant Access Prevention Mechanisms

### 5.1. Direct Company ID Checks

Most RLS policies directly compare `company_id` values to prevent cross-tenant access:

**Pattern**:
```sql
-- Generic pattern used across policies
WHERE table.company_id IN (
    SELECT company_id 
    FROM company_admin_requests 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND status = 'approved'
)
```

### 5.2. User-to-Company Mapping

The `app_user` table provides the authoritative mapping between users and companies:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- Users can only access data for their own company
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM app_user 
    WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND company_id = target_table.company_id
)
```

### 5.3. Developer Access Exception

The platform includes a developer access role that bypasses tenant restrictions for administrative purposes. This is controlled via a separate function:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- Example policy showing developer override
CREATE POLICY "Developers can view all companies" 
    ON "public"."company" 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING ("public"."has_developer_access"());
```

**Security Note**: Developer access is a privileged role that should be strictly controlled and audited. The presence of this exception is documented and intentional for platform administration.

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1. Strengths

✅ **Comprehensive RLS Coverage**: All 58+ tables have RLS enabled, ensuring database-level enforcement of tenant isolation.

✅ **Consistent Tenant Identifier**: The platform consistently uses `company_id` (UUID) as the tenant identifier across all relevant tables, reducing the risk of isolation gaps.

✅ **Security Definer Functions**: The use of `SECURITY DEFINER` functions (`is_approved_company_admin`, `is_rfx_participant`) provides centralized, auditable access control logic.

✅ **Multi-Layered RFX Isolation**: RFX data isolation uses multiple mechanisms (ownership, membership, company invitations) appropriate for the multi-party collaboration model.

✅ **Deny-by-Default Approach**: RLS policies follow a deny-by-default pattern, requiring explicit grants for access, which minimizes the risk of accidental cross-tenant data exposure.

✅ **Foreign Key Integrity**: Foreign key constraints on `company_id` ensure referential integrity and prevent orphaned records.

### 7.2. Recommendations

1. **Regular RLS Policy Audits**: Implement periodic reviews of RLS policies to ensure they remain aligned with business logic changes and new table additions.

2. **Developer Access Monitoring**: Establish logging and monitoring for developer access to track when privileged access is used, as this bypasses tenant isolation.

3. **RLS Policy Testing**: Consider implementing automated tests that verify RLS policies prevent cross-tenant access, especially after schema changes.

4. **Documentation of Access Patterns**: Maintain clear documentation of the different access patterns (company-scoped, RFX-scoped, user-scoped) to aid future development and audits.

5. **Public RFX Exception Review**: Review the public RFX feature (where anonymous users can view certain RFXs) to ensure it doesn't inadvertently expose tenant data beyond intended public examples.

### B. Key Security Functions

#### B.1. `is_approved_company_admin(company_id, user_id)`

**Purpose**: Verifies if a user is an approved admin of a specific company.

**Type**: `SECURITY DEFINER` (STABLE)

**Usage**: Used in RLS policies to grant company-scoped access.

#### B.2. `is_rfx_participant(rfx_id, user_id)`

**Purpose**: Verifies if a user is an owner or member of an RFX.

**Type**: `SECURITY DEFINER` (STABLE)

**Usage**: Used in RLS policies to grant RFX-scoped access.

#### B.3. `has_developer_access()`

**Purpose**: Verifies if a user has developer/administrative access.

**Type**: `SECURITY DEFINER` (STABLE)

**Usage**: Used to grant privileged access that bypasses tenant restrictions (for platform administration).

### C. RFX Access Model Details

RFX (Request for Exchange) data follows a multi-party access model:

1. **Buyers (RFX Owners/Members)**:
   - Access via `rfxs.user_id = auth.uid()` (owner)
   - Access via `rfx_members` table (explicit membership)

2. **Suppliers (Invited Companies)**:
   - Access via `rfx_company_invitations.company_id` matching user's company
   - Requires approved company admin status
   - Restricted by invitation status

3. **Developers**:
   - Full access for platform administration
   - Controlled via `has_developer_access()` function

This model allows controlled sharing of RFX data between buyers and suppliers while maintaining tenant isolation at the company level.
