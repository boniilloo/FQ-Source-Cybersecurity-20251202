# Cybersecurity Audit - Control GOV-03

## Control Information

- **Control ID**: GOV-03
- **Control Name**: Third-Party Management
- **Audit Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Client Question**: "Do you evaluate the security of the providers you use (e.g., AI, cloud)?"

---

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE**: The platform uses multiple third-party providers (Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare, Railway, OpenAI, Stripe) for critical infrastructure and services. While the platform leverages reputable providers with known security certifications, there is **no documented evidence** of formal security evaluation, due diligence processes, or ongoing security assessment procedures for these third-party providers in the codebase or documentation.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Provider Selection** - Platform uses well-established providers (Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare) with public security certifications
2. **No Documented Evaluation Process** - No evidence of formal security assessment, vendor risk management, or due diligence procedures
3. **No Security Documentation** - No documentation of provider security certifications, compliance status, or security reviews
4. **No Contractual Security Requirements** - No evidence of security requirements defined in contracts or service agreements
5. **No Ongoing Monitoring** - No documented process for monitoring provider security posture or compliance status

## 8. Control Compliance

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----|-----|----|
| Third-party providers are identified and documented | ✅ COMPLIANT | Providers identified: Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare, Railway, OpenAI, Stripe |
| Security evaluation process exists | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented security evaluation process found |
| Provider security certifications are documented | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documentation of provider certifications in codebase |
| Security requirements are defined for providers | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented security requirements for providers |
| Ongoing security monitoring is in place | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented process for monitoring provider security |
| Incident response procedures exist for provider incidents | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No documented procedures for provider security incidents |

**FINAL VERDICT**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE** with control GOV-03. The platform uses reputable third-party providers with known security certifications and implements proper security configurations. However, there is **no documented evidence** of formal security evaluation, vendor risk management processes, or ongoing security assessment procedures. While provider selection demonstrates security awareness, the lack of formal documentation and processes represents a gap in third-party risk management. The platform should establish a comprehensive vendor risk management program including formal security assessments, documentation of security certifications, contractual security requirements, and ongoing monitoring processes.
