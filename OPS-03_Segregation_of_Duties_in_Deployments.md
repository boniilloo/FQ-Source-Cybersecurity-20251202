# Cybersecurity Audit - Control OPS-03

## Control Information

- **Control ID**: OPS-03
- **Control Name**: Segregation of Duties in Deployments
- **Audit Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Client Question**: Who can deploy to production?

---

## Executive Summary

⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**: The platform currently has a single developer who is the only person with production deployment access across all deployment platforms (Vercel, Supabase, Railway). While deployment access is controlled through platform-specific authentication mechanisms, there is no formal segregation of duties between development and deployment roles, and no approval processes for production deployments. The current single-developer model makes segregation impractical, but the platform lacks documented procedures and controls that would enable proper segregation as the team grows.

1. **Single Developer Model** - Currently only one developer has production deployment access
2. **Platform-Based Access Control** - Deployment access controlled through Vercel, Supabase, and Railway platform authentication
3. **No Approval Processes** - No automated or manual approval workflows for production deployments
4. **No Role Separation** - No distinction between development and deployment roles
5. **Manual Deployment Process** - All deployments are manual, triggered by the developer with direct access
6. **No Audit Trail** - Limited deployment logging and audit capabilities

---

## 1. Current Deployment Access Model

### 1.1. Single Developer Access

The platform currently operates with a **single developer model** where one person has full access to deploy to all production environments:

- **Frontend (Vercel)**: Single developer has Vercel account access
- **Database/Edge Functions (Supabase)**: Single developer has Supabase CLI authentication
- **Backend (Railway)**: Single developer has Railway account access

**Evidence**:
```markdown
// Client Statement
"Aquí ahora mismo hay una sola persona desarrollando, y esa es la única que puede hacer deploy a produccion"
```

This model is common in early-stage development but lacks the controls necessary for proper segregation of duties as the organization scales.

### 1.2. Deployment Platform Access Control

Deployment access is controlled through platform-specific authentication mechanisms:

#### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

- **Access Method**: Vercel account authentication
- **Deployment Trigger**: Git commits to main branch (automatic) or manual deployment
- **Access Control**: Managed through Vercel dashboard (not in codebase)
- **No Code-Based Controls**: No repository-level access restrictions

**Evidence**:
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The `vercel.json` file contains deployment configuration but does not define access controls. Access is managed through the Vercel platform dashboard.

#### Database and Edge Functions Deployment (Supabase)

- **Access Method**: Supabase CLI authentication (`supabase login`)
- **Deployment Commands**: Manual CLI commands
- **Access Control**: Supabase project access managed through Supabase dashboard
- **Authentication**: Requires Supabase account credentials

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Deployment commands require authenticated Supabase CLI
supabase db push                    # Deploy database migrations
supabase functions deploy <name>   # Deploy edge functions
```

**Evidence**:
```markdown
// .cursor/rules/supabase.mdc
De momento trabajamos con la base de datos remota, por lo que tienes que hacer push al remoto después de haber creado migraciones para poder probar.
```

**Evidence**:
```markdown
// .cursor/rules/edgefunctiondeploy.mdc
Cuando se quiera actualizar la edge function de stripe-webhook hay que hacerlo con el comando de supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook --no-verify-jwt para evitar que salga un error de missing header.
```

#### Backend Deployment (Railway)

- **Access Method**: Railway account authentication
- **Deployment Method**: Railway platform-managed deployment
- **Access Control**: Managed through Railway dashboard (not in codebase)
- **Configuration**: Railway configuration managed through platform dashboard

**Evidence**:
```markdown
// cybersecurity_report_20251127/OPS-01_Deployment_Security.md
The platform uses Railway for backend services deployment. While specific Railway configuration files are not present in the repository (configuration managed through Railway dashboard), the deployment follows standard Railway practices:
- **Deployment Platform**: Railway
- **Service Configuration**: Managed through Railway dashboard
- **Environment Variables**: Configured through Railway environment variables
- **Containerized Deployment**: Railway automatically handles containerization and deployment
```

## 2. Deployment Process Analysis

### 2.1. Frontend Deployment Process (Vercel)

The frontend deployment process is **automated** but lacks approval controls:

1. **Trigger**: Git commit to main branch automatically triggers deployment
2. **Build**: Vercel automatically builds the application
3. **Deploy**: Build is automatically deployed to production
4. **No Approval Step**: No manual approval required before deployment

**Evidence**:
```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "build:dev": "vite build --mode development",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ **Automated**: Deployments happen automatically on commit
- ❌ **No Approval**: No approval process before production deployment
- ❌ **No Rollback Controls**: Rollback available but not controlled
- ⚠️ **Single Access Point**: Only one developer has Vercel account access

### 2.2. Database Deployment Process (Supabase)

The database deployment process is **manual** and requires direct CLI access:

1. **Development**: Developer creates migration files locally
2. **Local Testing**: Migrations tested in local Supabase instance
3. **Remote Deployment**: Developer runs `supabase db push` to deploy
4. **No Approval Step**: No approval process before production database changes

**Evidence**:
```markdown
// .cursor/rules/supabase.mdc
Para crear una migracion, usa siempre supabase migration new <nombre_de_la_migracion> para que todas las migraciones queden bien y sincronizadas.
```

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
-- Example migration file structure
-- All migrations follow timestamp-based naming: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql
```

**Characteristics**:
- ⚠️ **Manual Process**: Requires developer to execute CLI commands
- ❌ **No Approval**: No approval process before database changes
- ❌ **Direct Production Access**: Developer has direct access to production database
- ⚠️ **Single Access Point**: Only one developer has Supabase CLI access

### 2.3. Edge Functions Deployment Process (Supabase)

Edge functions deployment is **manual** and requires direct CLI access:

1. **Development**: Developer develops functions locally
2. **Local Testing**: Functions tested with `supabase functions serve`
3. **Production Deployment**: Developer runs `supabase functions deploy <name>`
4. **No Approval Step**: No approval process before production deployment

**Evidence**:
```markdown
// .cursor/rules/supabase.mdc
Cuando estamos trabajando con edge functions hayq que tener supabase functions serve corriendo para que las edge functions se vayan actualizando sobre la marcha.
```

**Evidence**:
```
// supabase/functions/
  - create-subscription/
  - manage-subscription/
  - stripe-webhook/
  - send-notification-email/
  - crypto-service/
  - generate-user-keys/
  - generate-company-keys/
  - ... (13 total edge functions)
```

**Characteristics**:
- ⚠️ **Manual Process**: Requires developer to execute CLI commands
- ❌ **No Approval**: No approval process before function deployment
- ❌ **Direct Production Access**: Developer has direct access to deploy functions
- ⚠️ **Single Access Point**: Only one developer has deployment access

### 2.4. Backend Deployment Process (Railway)

Backend deployment is managed through Railway platform:

1. **Configuration**: Managed through Railway dashboard
2. **Deployment**: Railway handles deployment automatically or manually
3. **Access Control**: Railway account-based access
4. **No Approval Step**: No approval process documented

**Characteristics**:
- ⚠️ **Platform-Managed**: Deployment handled by Railway platform
- ❌ **No Approval**: No approval process documented
- ❌ **Single Access Point**: Only one developer has Railway account access

## 3. Segregation of Duties Assessment

### 3.1. Current State: No Segregation

The platform currently has **no segregation of duties** for deployments:

- **Single Role**: One person performs both development and deployment
- **No Separation**: No distinction between development and deployment roles
- **No Approval Process**: No second person required to approve deployments
- **No Review Process**: No code review or deployment review process

**Evidence**:
```markdown
// Client Statement
"Aquí ahora mismo hay una sola persona desarrollando, y esa es la única que puede hacer deploy a produccion"
```

### 3.2. Missing Controls

The following segregation controls are **not implemented**:

1. **Separate Deployment Role**: No dedicated deployment role separate from development
2. **Approval Workflow**: No requirement for second person to approve deployments
3. **Code Review**: No mandatory code review before deployment
4. **Deployment Windows**: No restricted deployment windows or change management
5. **Access Logging**: Limited audit trail of who deployed what and when
6. **Least Privilege**: Single developer has full access to all deployment platforms

### 3.3. Platform Access Control Limitations

While deployment platforms (Vercel, Supabase, Railway) provide authentication mechanisms, they do not enforce segregation of duties:

- **Vercel**: Supports team members and roles, but currently only one person has access
- **Supabase**: CLI authentication is account-based, no role separation
- **Railway**: Supports team members, but currently only one person has access

**Evidence**: No team member configurations found in codebase, indicating single-user access model.

---

## 4. Deployment Access Control Mechanisms

### 4.1. Vercel Access Control

Vercel provides team and role management capabilities, but current implementation uses single-user access:

- **Team Management**: Vercel supports team members with different roles
- **Role-Based Access**: Vercel provides roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- **Current State**: Single developer has full access (likely Owner or Admin role)
- **No Team Configuration**: No evidence of team members or role assignments in codebase

**Evidence**: No Vercel team configuration files found in repository.

### 4.2. Supabase Access Control

Supabase CLI access is account-based:

- **Authentication**: Requires Supabase account login (`supabase login`)
- **Project Access**: Access controlled at project level in Supabase dashboard
- **No Role Separation**: CLI access is binary (has access or doesn't)
- **Current State**: Single developer has project access

**Evidence**:
```toml
// supabase/config.toml
project_id = "fukzxedgbszcpakqkrjf"
```

The `project_id` identifies the Supabase project but does not control access. Access is managed through Supabase dashboard.

### 4.3. Railway Access Control

Railway supports team members and roles:

- **Team Management**: Railway supports team members with different permissions
- **Role-Based Access**: Railway provides different permission levels
- **Current State**: Single developer has account access
- **No Team Configuration**: No evidence of team members in codebase

**Evidence**: No Railway team configuration found in repository.

---

## 5. Deployment Audit and Logging

### 5.1. Available Logging

Deployment platforms provide some logging capabilities:

#### Vercel Logging
- **Deployment History**: Vercel maintains deployment history
- **Build Logs**: Build logs available for each deployment
- **Access Logs**: Limited access logging through Vercel dashboard

#### Supabase Logging
- **Migration History**: Migration files tracked in version control
- **Function Logs**: Edge function execution logs available via CLI
- **Access Logs**: Limited access logging through Supabase dashboard

**Evidence**:
```bash
# View edge function logs
supabase functions logs
supabase functions logs [function-name]
```

#### Railway Logging
- **Deployment Logs**: Railway provides deployment and runtime logs
- **Access Logs**: Limited access logging through Railway dashboard

### 5.2. Audit Trail Limitations

The current deployment model has **limited audit capabilities**:

- ❌ **No Centralized Logging**: Logs scattered across multiple platforms
- ❌ **No Deployment Approval Records**: No records of who approved deployments
- ⚠️ **Version Control History**: Git history provides some audit trail for code changes
- ⚠️ **Migration History**: Migration files provide audit trail for database changes
- ❌ **No Deployment Person Tracking**: Limited ability to track who performed deployments

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Migration files provide some audit trail
supabase/migrations/
  - 20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
  - 20251121133135_add_user_keys_columns.sql
  - 20251125173210_get_developer_public_keys.sql
  - 20251126085807_fix_app_user_rls_policies.sql
  # ... (21 total migration files)
```

Migration files are timestamped and version-controlled, providing some audit trail, but they don't record who executed the deployment.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### 6.1. Current Risk Level

The current single-developer deployment model presents **moderate to high risk** for segregation of duties:

| Risk Factor | Level | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Single Point of Failure | High | Only one person can deploy, creating dependency risk |
| No Approval Process | High | No second person reviews or approves deployments |
| No Separation of Roles | High | Developer and deployer are the same person |
| Limited Audit Trail | Medium | Some logging available but not centralized |
| No Change Management | Medium | No formal change management process |
| Direct Production Access | High | Developer has direct access to all production systems |

### 6.2. Potential Issues

Without proper segregation of duties, the following issues may occur:

1. **Unauthorized Changes**: No approval process means unauthorized changes could be deployed
2. **Error Introduction**: No review process increases risk of bugs reaching production
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: No security review before deployment
4. **Compliance Violations**: Lack of controls may violate compliance requirements
5. **Single Point of Failure**: If the developer is unavailable, deployments cannot proceed
6. **No Accountability**: Limited ability to determine who made what changes and when

---

## 7. Conclusions

### 7.1. Strengths

✅ **Platform-Based Access Control**: Deployment access is controlled through platform authentication mechanisms (Vercel, Supabase, Railway)

✅ **Version-Controlled Changes**: All code and database changes are tracked in version control, providing some audit trail

✅ **Local Testing**: Changes are tested locally before deployment, reducing risk of errors

✅ **Documented Procedures**: Deployment procedures are documented in cursor rules and guides

✅ **Migration-Based Database Changes**: Database changes are managed through version-controlled migration files with timestamps

### 7.2. Recommendations

1. **Implement Approval Workflow**: Establish a requirement for a second person to approve production deployments before they proceed

2. **Separate Development and Deployment Roles**: As the team grows, assign separate roles for development and deployment, ensuring developers cannot deploy their own changes without approval

3. **Implement Code Review Process**: Require code review before deployments, ensuring at least one other person reviews changes

4. **Configure Team Access**: Configure team members in Vercel, Supabase, and Railway with appropriate role-based access controls

5. **Implement Deployment Windows**: Establish deployment windows and change management processes for production deployments

6. **Centralize Audit Logging**: Implement centralized logging of all deployment activities, including who deployed what, when, and with whose approval

7. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**: Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) that enforces approval workflows and provides better audit trails

8. **Document Deployment Procedures**: Create formal deployment runbooks that document the approval process and segregation requirements

9. **Implement Least Privilege**: As the team grows, implement least privilege access, ensuring developers only have access to what they need for their role

10. **Regular Access Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of who has deployment access and ensure access is appropriate for their role

---

## 8. Control Compliance

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Defined deployment access controls | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Platform-based authentication exists, but no formal access control documentation |
| Segregation between development and deployment roles | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | Single developer performs both development and deployment |
| Approval process for production deployments | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No approval process exists |
| Audit trail of deployment activities | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Some logging available through platforms, but not centralized |
| Access review procedures | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No access review procedures documented |
| Team member configuration | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | Only single developer has access, no team configuration |
| Deployment role separation | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No separation between development and deployment roles |
| Change management process | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | No formal change management process for deployments |

**FINAL VERDICT**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT** with control OPS-03. The platform implements basic access controls through deployment platform authentication (Vercel, Supabase, Railway), and all changes are version-controlled providing some audit trail. However, the current single-developer model means there is no segregation of duties between development and deployment roles, no approval processes for production deployments, and no formal access control procedures. While this may be acceptable for a single-developer scenario, the platform lacks the controls and procedures necessary to properly implement segregation of duties as the organization scales.
