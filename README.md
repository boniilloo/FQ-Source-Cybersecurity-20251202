## Controls Compliance Table

| Domain | Control ID CCM | Control | User_question | FQ_Source_answer | What customer expects (may be present or not) | Available evidence | State | Notes |
|--------|----------------|---------|---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------|-------|
| Identity, Access and Identity Management (IAM) | IAM-01 | Identity and Role Management | "How do you manage users, roles, and permissions on the platform?" | We use Supabase Auth with per-tenant roles and JWT claims. Permissions are applied using Row Level Security (RLS) policies in the database. | To see that a formal model for identity and permission management exists, not 'ad hoc' access. | Role and permission model, identity management policy, RLS extract. | Compliant | |
| | IAM-03 | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | "Do you have MFA for sensitive access?" | Yes. MFA is enabled for administrative accounts and can be required for users accessing sensitive modules like the RFX area. | Critical access is reinforced with MFA. | Reinforced access policy, MFA configuration screenshots. | Partially Compliant | Roadmap 2026 |
| | IAM-04 | Access Revocation | "How is a user's access revoked (offboarding, role change, etc.)?" | Revocation is done by disabling the account, invalidating active tokens, and updating roles in the database. | A clear, fast, and centralized revocation procedure. | User offboarding procedure, evidence of deletions. | Compliant | |
| | IAM-06 | Segregation by Tenant | "How do you guarantee that one client cannot access another's data?" | We use Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables with company_id as the tenant identifier. All 58+ tables have RLS enabled with deny-by-default policies. | Strong isolation between clients (secure multi-tenancy). | RLS definitions, data architecture diagram. | Compliant | |
| | IAM-07 | Segregation of Administrative Duties | "Is there segregation between technical and functional administration?" | We implement separate roles: Developer (technical), Platform Admin and Company Admin (functional). However, developers can manage functional admin roles, which we are working to improve. | That there isn't a single role with 'absolute power' without control. | Internal roles matrix. | Partially Compliant | Roadmap 2026 |
| | IAM-08 | Privileged Account Management | "How do you manage accounts with elevated privileges?" | Privileged accounts are minimal and task-specific. MFA is enabled for developer accounts. Access is controlled through RLS policies and stored in separate tables with audit trails (granted_by, granted_at). | Strict control over privileged accounts. | Privileged accounts policy. | Compliant | |
| Data Security and Encryption (DSI, EKM) | DSI-01 | Information Classification | "Do you classify data types (personal, RFX, logs, etc.)?" | Yes. We use a four-tier classification system: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted. Each level has specific security controls (encryption, RLS, access restrictions) documented in our cybersecurity protocol. | A classification scheme that justifies different controls according to the data type. | Information classification document. | Compliant | |
| | DSI-05 | Data Isolation | "How do you prevent unauthorized access to other users' data?" | We implement Row Level Security (RLS) on all 65+ database tables with deny-by-default policies. Access is controlled through security functions that verify user ownership, company membership, and RFX participation. | See technical isolation mechanisms (not just procedural ones). | RLS policies, access tests. | Compliant | |
| | EKM-03 | Encryption at Rest | "Is the platform data encrypted at rest?" | Yes. All data is encrypted at rest using Supabase's AES-256 encryption with FIPS 140-2 compliant HSMs. Additionally, sensitive data (RFX specs, private keys) uses application-level AES-256-GCM encryption. | Robust encryption at rest, preferably managed by the cloud provider. | Encryption policy, Supabase documentation. | Compliant | |
| | EKM-04 | Encryption in Transit | "Is communication between client and server encrypted?" | Yes. All communications use TLS/HTTPS. WebSocket connections use WSS protocol. All Railway-hosted services and Supabase APIs are accessed via encrypted channels. | Exclusive use of TLS in all external communications. | TLS configurations, SSL Labs tests. | Compliant | |
| | EKM-05 | Key Management | "How do you manage encryption keys?" | Clients do not manage keys. Master encryption key is stored in Supabase Secrets (server-side only). User private keys are encrypted with the master key via a secure Edge Function. RFX keys are distributed automatically to authorized users. | That the client does not have to manage keys and no exposed keys exist. | Key management model, secrets configuration. | Compliant | |
| | EKM-06 | Encryption Algorithms and Scheme | "What encryption algorithms do you use to protect data and encryption keys?" | We use AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption and RSA-OAEP 4096-bit for asymmetric encryption.

| | DSI-08 | Encryption of Sensitive Data (RFX) | "Are RFXs additionally encrypted?" | Yes. RFXs use a hybrid encryption model: AES-256-GCM for data encryption and RSA-OAEP 4096-bit for key distribution. All sensitive RFX fields and images are encrypted before storage. | A clear hybrid model to protect sensitive documents. | RFX encryption technical document, flow diagram. | Compliant | |
| AI Agent Security (IA) | IA-01 | Data Usage for Training | "Do you use client data to train AI models?" | No. We have a Data Processing Agreement with OpenAI that explicitly prohibits using Customer Data for training. We only use pre-trained OpenAI models and perform prompt tuning, not model training. | Explicit confirmation that client data is not used to train models. | AI provider statement, internal AI policy. | Compliant | |
| | IA-02 | Data Minimization Sent to LLM | "Do you send entire documents or only relevant fragments to the AI model?" | Our RAG pipeline returns only fragment identifiers and metadata. Complete documents are sent when necessary for accurate technical analysis, with size limits (100,000 characters). Product/company evaluations use only relevant columns from database views. | Minimization and control of the context seen by the model. | AI pipeline architecture. | Partially Compliant | Roadmap 2026 |
| | IA-03 | Prompt Injection Prevention | "Do you apply controls to prevent prompt injection or jailbreak attacks?" | We use message structure separation (LangChain SystemMessage/HumanMessage) and store system prompts in Supabase.

| | IA-06 | Output Filtering | "Do you apply filters on the responses generated by the AI?" | We rely on system prompts to guide AI behavior, but explicit technical output filtering mechanisms are not yet implemented. Responses are transmitted directly without content validation or moderation. | Controls to prevent toxic/sensitive outputs. | AI content policies specification. | Non compliant | Roadmap 2026 |
| | IA-07 | System Prompt Governance | "Who can modify the behavior of the AI agent (system prompt)?" | Only developers can modify system prompts through the Settings page (frontend and database RLS protected). All changes are versioned with timestamps, user attribution, comments, and restoration capabilities. | Governance over the critical agent configuration. | Prompt change procedure. | Compliant | |
| | IA-08 | AI Risk Assessment | "Have you carried out a specific risk assessment for the use of AI?" | We have implemented multiple AI security controls (IA-02 through IA-06), but a formal, comprehensive AI risk assessment document is not yet available. Risk recognition is implicit through implemented security measures. | Explicit recognition of AI risk and mitigation measures. | AI risk analysis report. | Partially Compliant | Ongoing periodic review. |

All endpoints require authentication except one low-risk geocoding function. | That there are no open endpoints without control. | API architecture diagram. | Compliant | |
| | SEF-06 | Session Management | "How do you manage user sessions and tokens?" | We use Supabase Auth with JWT tokens expiring after 1 hour. Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration. Refresh token rotation is enabled with a 10-second reuse interval. Logout invalidates sessions across all devices. | Adequate token management, without eternal sessions. | Session policy, JWT configuration. | Compliant | |
| | SEF-07 | CSRF/CORS Protection | "Do you have measures against CSRF and secure CORS configuration?" | We use JWT-based authentication for CSRF protection and configure security headers. However, CORS configuration is inconsistent; most Edge Functions use wildcard (*) while one critical function uses proper origin validation. | Verify that 'CORS: *' is not accepted without further control. | CORS configuration, web security review. | Partially Compliant | Roadmap 2026 |
| | SEF-08 | Brute Force Protection | "Do you protect login forms against brute force?" | Yes.
