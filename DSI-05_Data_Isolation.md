# Cybersecurity Audit - Control DSI-05

## Control Information

- **Control ID**: DSI-05
- **Control Name**: Data Isolation
- **Audit Date**: 2025-11-27
- **Client Question**: How do you prevent unauthorized access to other users' data?

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **COMPLIANCE**: The platform implements comprehensive technical data isolation mechanisms through Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all database tables, security definer functions for access control, and encryption-based isolation for sensitive data. The system enforces deny-by-default access patterns and uses multiple layers of isolation at the user, company, and project (RFX) levels.

1. **Universal RLS Enforcement** - All database tables have Row Level Security enabled with deny-by-default policies
2. **User-Level Isolation** - Direct user data (profiles, messages, saved items) is isolated using `auth.uid()` checks
3. **Company-Level Isolation** - Company data is isolated using security functions that verify company membership and admin status
4. **RFX-Level Isolation** - Project data uses both RLS policies and encryption-based isolation with per-project symmetric keys
5. **Security Functions** - SECURITY DEFINER functions prevent policy recursion and provide centralized access control logic
6. **Multi-Layer Protection** - Combination of database-level RLS, application-level encryption, and function-based access checks

---

## 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Foundation

### 1.1. Universal RLS Enforcement

The platform implements **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all database tables, ensuring that data access is controlled at the database level. This provides a technical isolation mechanism that cannot be bypassed by application code.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
ALTER TABLE "public"."app_user" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."chat_messages" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."company" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."company_admin_requests" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."rfxs" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."rfx_specs" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."rfx_members" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."saved_companies" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "public"."user_feedback" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ... and 50+ additional tables
```

**Coverage**: The migration files show that **65+ tables** have RLS enabled, ensuring comprehensive data isolation across the entire platform.

### 1.2. Deny-by-Default Pattern

RLS policies follow a **deny-by-default** approach, meaning that unless an explicit policy allows access, all data is inaccessible. This ensures that new tables or data structures are secure by default.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
-- Example: Users can only view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
  ON "public"."app_user" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "auth_user_id"));
```

This policy explicitly grants access only when the authenticated user's ID matches the profile's `auth_user_id`, denying access to all other users' profiles.

---

## 2. User-Level Data Isolation

### 2.1. Personal Profile Isolation

User profiles are isolated so that users can only access their own profile data. The isolation is enforced through RLS policies that compare the authenticated user's ID with the profile's `auth_user_id`.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251126085807_fix_app_user_rls_policies.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own profile"
  ON "public"."app_user"
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = auth_user_id);

-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
  ON "public"."app_user" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "auth_user_id"));
```

**Isolation Mechanism**: The `auth.uid()` function returns the authenticated user's UUID from the JWT token, which is compared against the `auth_user_id` field in the `app_user` table. This ensures that:
- Users can only create profiles for themselves
- Users can only view their own profile
- Other users' profiles are inaccessible

### 2.2. Personal Data Isolation

All user-specific data tables implement isolation policies that restrict access to the data owner:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own admin requests" 
  ON "public"."company_admin_requests" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own company requests" 
  ON "public"."company_requests" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own feedback" 
  ON "public"."user_feedback" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own lists" 
  ON "public"."supplier_lists" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own saved companies" 
  ON "public"."saved_companies" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own terms acceptance" 
  ON "public"."terms_acceptance" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own type selection" 
  ON "public"."user_type_selections" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));
```

**Isolation Pattern**: Each policy uses the pattern `auth.uid() = [table].user_id`, ensuring that users can only access rows where they are the owner.

### 2.3. Conversation and Message Isolation

Conversations and chat messages are isolated to prevent users from accessing other users' private conversations:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to own conversations or anonymous conversations" 
  ON "public"."conversations" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((("user_id" IS NULL) OR ("auth"."uid"() = "user_id")));

CREATE POLICY "Allow viewing messages from accessible conversations" 
  ON "public"."chat_messages" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((EXISTS ( 
    SELECT 1
    FROM "public"."conversations"
    WHERE (("conversations"."id" = "chat_messages"."conversation_id") 
      AND (("conversations"."user_id" IS NULL) 
        OR ("conversations"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()))))));
```

**Isolation Mechanism**: Messages are isolated through a join check with the parent conversation table. Users can only access messages from conversations they own (or anonymous conversations). This prevents users from accessing messages from other users' conversations.

---

## 3. Company-Level Data Isolation

### 3.1. Company Admin Access Control

Company-level data is isolated using security functions that verify company membership and admin status. The `is_approved_company_admin()` function provides centralized access control logic.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_approved_company_admin"(
  "p_company_id" "uuid", 
  "p_user_id" "uuid" DEFAULT "auth"."uid"()
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    SET "search_path" TO 'public'
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM company_admin_requests 
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id 
    AND company_id = p_company_id
    AND status = 'approved'
  );
$$;
```

**Usage in RLS Policies**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "stripe_customers_select_for_company_admins" 
  ON "public"."stripe_customers" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ("public"."is_approved_company_admin"("company_id"));

CREATE POLICY "company_billing_info_select_for_company_admins" 
  ON "public"."company_billing_info" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ("public"."is_approved_company_admin"("company_id"));
```

**Isolation Mechanism**: Company-sensitive data (billing information, Stripe customers, payment history) is only accessible to users who have approved admin status for that specific company. The function checks the `company_admin_requests` table to verify the user's approved admin status.

### 3.2. Company Admin Request Isolation

Users can only view their own company admin requests, preventing them from seeing requests from other users:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own admin requests" 
  ON "public"."company_admin_requests" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

CREATE POLICY "Approved company admins can view all requests for their company" 
  ON "public"."company_admin_requests" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("public"."is_approved_company_admin"("company_id") 
    OR "public"."has_developer_access"()));
```

**Isolation Pattern**: Users can view their own requests, and approved company admins can view all requests for their company. This ensures that:
- Users cannot see other users' admin requests
- Company admins can manage requests for their company only
- Developers have elevated access for platform management

---

## 4. RFX-Level Data Isolation

### 4.1. RFX Ownership Isolation

RFX (Request for eXchange) projects are isolated so that users can only access RFXs they own or are members of:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own RFXs" 
  ON "public"."rfxs" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));
```

**Isolation Mechanism**: Users can only view RFXs where they are the owner (`user_id = auth.uid()`). This prevents users from accessing RFXs created by other users.

### 4.2. RFX Participant Access

RFX members can access RFX data through the `is_rfx_participant()` security function, which checks both ownership and membership:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_rfx_participant"(
  "p_rfx_id" "uuid", 
  "p_user_id" "uuid"
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    AS $$
  -- Check if user is owner of RFX
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfxs
    WHERE id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  )
  OR
  -- Or if user is a member
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfx_members
    WHERE rfx_id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  );
$$;
```

**Usage in RLS Policies**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "rfx_members_select_if_participant" 
  ON "public"."rfx_members" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ("public"."is_rfx_participant"("rfx_id", "auth"."uid"()));

COMMENT ON POLICY "rfx_members_select_if_participant" 
  ON "public"."rfx_members" 
  IS 'Users can see all members of RFXs they own or belong to (using security definer function to avoid recursion)';
```

**Isolation Mechanism**: The function checks both RFX ownership and membership in the `rfx_members` table. This allows:
- RFX owners to see all members
- RFX members to see other members of the same RFX
- Prevents access to members of RFXs the user is not part of

### 4.3. RFX Data Isolation

RFX-related data (specs, validations, selected candidates) is isolated using ownership and participant checks:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view specs for their own RFXs" 
  ON "public"."rfx_specs" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((EXISTS ( 
    SELECT 1
    FROM "public"."rfxs"
    WHERE (("rfxs"."id" = "rfx_specs"."rfx_id") 
      AND ("rfxs"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()))))));

CREATE POLICY "Users can view validations for their RFXs" 
  ON "public"."rfx_validations" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((EXISTS ( 
    SELECT 1
    FROM "public"."rfxs"
    WHERE (("rfxs"."id" = "rfx_validations"."rfx_id") 
      AND (("rfxs"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()) 
        OR (EXISTS ( 
          SELECT 1
          FROM "public"."rfx_members"
          WHERE (("rfx_members"."rfx_id" = "rfxs"."id") 
            AND ("rfx_members"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"())))))))));
```

**Isolation Pattern**: RFX data is isolated through subqueries that check:
1. If the user is the RFX owner
2. If the user is a member of the RFX (for some data types)

This ensures that RFX data is only accessible to authorized participants.

### 4.4. RFX Conversation Isolation

RFX-specific conversations are isolated to prevent users from accessing conversations from RFXs they don't have access to:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251124102943_create_rfx_conversations_tables.sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to own rfx conversations or anonymous rfx conversations" 
  ON "public"."rfx_conversations" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((("user_id" IS NULL) OR ("auth"."uid"() = "user_id")));

CREATE POLICY "Allow viewing messages from accessible rfx conversations" 
  ON "public"."rfx_chat_messages" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((EXISTS ( 
    SELECT 1
    FROM "public"."rfx_conversations"
    WHERE (("rfx_conversations"."id" = "rfx_chat_messages"."conversation_id") 
      AND (("rfx_conversations"."user_id" IS NULL) 
        OR ("rfx_conversations"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()))))));
```

**Isolation Mechanism**: RFX conversations and messages are isolated through ownership checks. Users can only access conversations they own or anonymous conversations within RFXs they have access to.

## 5. Security Functions for Access Control

### 5.1. Security Definer Functions

The platform uses **SECURITY DEFINER** functions to provide centralized access control logic and prevent RLS policy recursion. These functions run with elevated privileges but are carefully designed to only return boolean access decisions.

**Key Security Functions**:

#### 5.1.1. `is_rfx_participant()`
- **Purpose**: Check if a user is an owner or member of an RFX
- **Type**: SECURITY DEFINER, STABLE
- **Usage**: Prevents recursion in RLS policies for RFX-related tables

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_rfx_participant"(
  "p_rfx_id" "uuid", 
  "p_user_id" "uuid"
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfxs
    WHERE id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  )
  OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfx_members
    WHERE rfx_id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  );
$$;

COMMENT ON FUNCTION "public"."is_rfx_participant"(
  "p_rfx_id" "uuid", 
  "p_user_id" "uuid"
) IS 'Check if a user is owner or member of an RFX - used by RLS policies to avoid recursion';
```

#### 5.1.2. `is_approved_company_admin()`
- **Purpose**: Verify if a user has approved admin status for a company
- **Type**: SECURITY DEFINER, STABLE
- **Usage**: Controls access to company-sensitive data

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_approved_company_admin"(
  "p_company_id" "uuid", 
  "p_user_id" "uuid" DEFAULT "auth"."uid"()
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    SET "search_path" TO 'public'
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM company_admin_requests 
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id 
    AND company_id = p_company_id
    AND status = 'approved'
  );
$$;
```

#### 5.1.3. `has_developer_access()`
- **Purpose**: Check if a user has developer-level access
- **Type**: SECURITY DEFINER, STABLE
- **Usage**: Provides elevated access for platform developers

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."has_developer_access"(
  "check_user_id" "uuid" DEFAULT "auth"."uid"()
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    SET "search_path" TO 'public'
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM public.developer_access 
    WHERE user_id = check_user_id
  );
$$;
```

**Isolation Benefit**: These functions provide centralized, reusable access control logic that:
- Prevents RLS policy recursion
- Ensures consistent access control across the platform
- Simplifies policy maintenance
- Provides a single point of truth for access decisions

---

## 6. Encryption-Based Data Isolation

### 6.1. RFX Encryption Isolation

Beyond RLS policies, RFX data uses **encryption-based isolation** to provide an additional layer of protection. Each RFX has its own symmetric encryption key, and only authorized participants have access to the decrypted key.

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121193506_add_rfx_key_members.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "public"."rfx_key_members" (
    "rfx_id" "uuid" NOT NULL REFERENCES "public"."rfxs"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "user_id" "uuid" NOT NULL REFERENCES "auth"."users"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "encrypted_symmetric_key" "text" NOT NULL,
    "created_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT "now"() NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY ("rfx_id", "user_id")
);

ALTER TABLE "public"."rfx_key_members" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own keys" 
  ON "public"."rfx_key_members"
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Isolation Mechanism**:
1. Each RFX has a unique symmetric encryption key (AES-256-GCM)
2. The key is encrypted with each participant's public key
3. Only users with access to their encrypted key in `rfx_key_members` can decrypt RFX data
4. RLS ensures users can only access their own encrypted keys

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// src/hooks/useRFXCrypto.ts
export const useRFXCrypto = (rfxId: string | null) => {
  // ... initialization code ...
  
  // Get RFX Symmetric Key
  const { data: rfxKeyData, error: rfxKeyError } = await supabase
    .from('rfx_key_members')
    .select('encrypted_symmetric_key')
    .eq('rfx_id', rfxId)
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
    .maybeSingle();
  
  // Decrypt Symmetric Key using user's private key
  const symmetricKey = await userCrypto.decryptSymmetricKey(
    rfxKeyData.encrypted_symmetric_key,
    sessionPrivateKey
  );
  
  // Use symmetric key to decrypt RFX data
};
```

**Isolation Benefit**: Even if RLS policies were bypassed, encrypted RFX data would remain inaccessible without the proper decryption key, providing defense-in-depth.

### 6.2. Company-Level Encryption Isolation

Companies also use encryption-based isolation for RFX data, with company-level keys stored separately:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251126111326_create_rfx_company_keys_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "public"."rfx_company_keys" (
    "rfx_id" "uuid" NOT NULL REFERENCES "public"."rfxs"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "company_id" "uuid" NOT NULL REFERENCES "public"."company"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
    "encrypted_symmetric_key" "text" NOT NULL,
    "created_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT "now"() NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY ("rfx_id", "company_id")
);

ALTER TABLE "public"."rfx_company_keys" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Isolation Mechanism**: Company-level keys provide an additional isolation layer, ensuring that:
- Companies can only access RFX data for RFXs they are invited to
- Company keys are encrypted with the company's public key
- RLS policies restrict access to company keys based on company membership

---

## 7. Multi-Layer Isolation Architecture

### 7.1. Defense-in-Depth Strategy

The platform implements a **multi-layer isolation strategy** that combines:

1. **Database-Level Isolation (RLS)**: Primary isolation mechanism enforced at the database level
2. **Function-Based Access Control**: Centralized access logic through SECURITY DEFINER functions
3. **Encryption-Based Isolation**: Additional protection for sensitive data through encryption
4. **Application-Level Validation**: Client-side hooks and context providers enforce access rules

**Architecture Diagram**:
```
User Request
    ↓
Application Layer (React Hooks/Context)
    ↓
Supabase Client (JWT Authentication)
    ↓
Database Layer (RLS Policies)
    ↓
Security Functions (Access Control Logic)
    ↓
Encryption Layer (For Sensitive Data)
    ↓
Data Access
```

### 7.2. Isolation Layers by Data Type

| Data Type | RLS Policy | Security Function | Encryption | Isolation Level |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| User Profile | ✅ `auth.uid() = auth_user_id` | - | - | User-level |
| Personal Data | ✅ `auth.uid() = user_id` | - | - | User-level |
| Company Data | ✅ Company membership check | ✅ `is_approved_company_admin()` | - | Company-level |
| RFX Data | ✅ Ownership/membership check | ✅ `is_rfx_participant()` | ✅ AES-256-GCM | RFX-level |
| RFX Keys | ✅ `auth.uid() = user_id` | - | ✅ RSA-OAEP 4096 | User-level + Encryption |

---

## 8. Access Control Patterns

### 8.1. Direct User ID Comparison

**Pattern**: `auth.uid() = [table].user_id`

**Usage**: Personal data, user profiles, saved items

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
  ON "public"."app_user" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "auth_user_id"));
```

### 8.2. Subquery Ownership Check

**Pattern**: `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM parent_table WHERE parent.user_id = auth.uid())`

**Usage**: Related data that references a parent entity

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view specs for their own RFXs" 
  ON "public"."rfx_specs" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((EXISTS ( 
    SELECT 1
    FROM "public"."rfxs"
    WHERE (("rfxs"."id" = "rfx_specs"."rfx_id") 
      AND ("rfxs"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"())))));
```

### 8.3. Security Function Check

**Pattern**: `security_function(parameters)`

**Usage**: Complex access logic, preventing recursion

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "rfx_members_select_if_participant" 
  ON "public"."rfx_members" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ("public"."is_rfx_participant"("rfx_id", "auth"."uid"()));
```

### 8.4. Combined Checks

**Pattern**: Multiple conditions with OR/AND logic

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view validations for their RFXs" 
  ON "public"."rfx_validations" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((EXISTS ( 
    SELECT 1
    FROM "public"."rfxs"
    WHERE (("rfxs"."id" = "rfx_validations"."rfx_id") 
      AND (("rfxs"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"()) 
        OR (EXISTS ( 
          SELECT 1
          FROM "public"."rfx_members"
          WHERE (("rfx_members"."rfx_id" = "rfxs"."id") 
            AND ("rfx_members"."user_id" = "auth"."uid"())))))))));
```

---

## 9. Developer Access Exception

### 9.1. Developer Override Policies

Developers have elevated access for platform management, but this access is explicitly granted through separate policies:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251124102943_create_rfx_conversations_tables.sql
CREATE POLICY "Developers can view all rfx conversations" 
  ON "public"."rfx_conversations" 
  FOR SELECT 
  TO "authenticated" 
  USING ("public"."has_developer_access"());

CREATE POLICY "Developers can view all rfx chat messages" 
  ON "public"."rfx_chat_messages" 
  FOR SELECT 
  TO "authenticated" 
  USING ("public"."has_developer_access"());
```

**Isolation Note**: Developer access is:
- Explicitly defined in separate policies
- Controlled through the `developer_access` table
- Verified using the `has_developer_access()` security function
- Limited to specific tables and operations
- Not a bypass of isolation, but a controlled exception for platform management

---

## 10. Public Data Access

### 10.1. Public RFX Access

Some RFX data is intentionally public, with explicit policies that allow public access:

**Evidence**:
```sql
-- supabase/migrations/20251121132118_remote_schema_baseline.sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view public RFXs" 
  ON "public"."rfxs" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ((EXISTS ( 
    SELECT 1
    FROM "public"."public_rfxs"
    WHERE ("public_rfxs"."rfx_id" = "rfxs"."id"))));
```

**Isolation Note**: Public access is:
- Explicitly defined through separate policies
- Limited to specific data marked as public
- Controlled through the `public_rfxs` table
- Not a security vulnerability, but an intentional feature for public RFX visibility

---

## 11. Conclusions

### 11.1. Strengths

✅ **Universal RLS Enforcement**: All database tables have Row Level Security enabled, providing comprehensive data isolation at the database level

✅ **Deny-by-Default Pattern**: RLS policies follow a deny-by-default approach, ensuring that new data structures are secure by default

✅ **Multi-Layer Isolation**: The platform implements isolation at multiple levels (user, company, RFX) with appropriate access controls for each

✅ **Security Functions**: SECURITY DEFINER functions provide centralized access control logic, prevent policy recursion, and ensure consistent access decisions

✅ **Encryption-Based Isolation**: Sensitive RFX data uses encryption-based isolation in addition to RLS, providing defense-in-depth protection

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: 65+ tables have RLS enabled, ensuring that all user data is protected by technical isolation mechanisms

✅ **Explicit Access Patterns**: Access control patterns are clearly defined and consistently applied across the platform

### 11.2. Recommendations

1. **Regular RLS Policy Audits**: Conduct periodic audits to ensure all new tables have RLS enabled and policies are correctly configured

2. **Access Testing**: Implement automated tests that verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized access to other users' data

3. **Policy Documentation**: Maintain documentation of access patterns and security functions to facilitate maintenance and onboarding

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement monitoring to detect potential RLS policy bypass attempts or unusual access patterns

5. **Encryption Key Management**: Ensure proper key rotation and management procedures for encryption-based isolation mechanisms

## 12. Control Compliance

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Technical isolation mechanisms implemented | ✅ COMPLIANT | RLS enabled on all 65+ tables with deny-by-default policies |
| User-level data isolation | ✅ COMPLIANT | Direct user ID comparison policies for personal data |
| Company-level data isolation | ✅ COMPLIANT | Security functions verify company membership and admin status |
| RFX-level data isolation | ✅ COMPLIANT | Ownership/membership checks with encryption-based isolation |
| Security functions for access control | ✅ COMPLIANT | SECURITY DEFINER functions prevent recursion and provide centralized logic |
| Multi-layer protection | ✅ COMPLIANT | Combination of RLS, security functions, and encryption |
| Comprehensive coverage | ✅ COMPLIANT | All user-accessible tables have RLS enabled |

**FINAL VERDICT**: ✅ **COMPLIANT** with control DSI-05. The platform implements comprehensive technical data isolation mechanisms through Row Level Security policies on all database tables, security definer functions for access control, and encryption-based isolation for sensitive data. The system enforces deny-by-default access patterns and uses multiple layers of isolation at the user, company, and project (RFX) levels, effectively preventing unauthorized access to other users' data.

### A. RLS Policy Examples by Category

#### A.1. User Profile Policies
```sql
-- Users can only view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
  ON "public"."app_user" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "auth_user_id"));

-- Users can only create their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own profile"
  ON "public"."app_user"
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = auth_user_id);
```

#### A.2. Personal Data Policies
```sql
-- Users can only view their own saved companies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own saved companies" 
  ON "public"."saved_companies" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

-- Users can only view their own feedback
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own feedback" 
  ON "public"."user_feedback" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));
```

#### A.3. Company Data Policies
```sql
-- Only approved company admins can view company billing info
CREATE POLICY "company_billing_info_select_for_company_admins" 
  ON "public"."company_billing_info" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ("public"."is_approved_company_admin"("company_id"));
```

#### A.4. RFX Data Policies
```sql
-- Users can only view RFXs they own
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own RFXs" 
  ON "public"."rfxs" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (("auth"."uid"() = "user_id"));

-- RFX members can view other members
CREATE POLICY "rfx_members_select_if_participant" 
  ON "public"."rfx_members" 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING ("public"."is_rfx_participant"("rfx_id", "auth"."uid"()));
```

### B. Security Function Definitions

#### B.1. `is_rfx_participant()`
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_rfx_participant"(
  "p_rfx_id" "uuid", 
  "p_user_id" "uuid"
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfxs
    WHERE id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  )
  OR
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.rfx_members
    WHERE rfx_id = p_rfx_id
    AND user_id = p_user_id
  );
$$;
```

#### B.2. `is_approved_company_admin()`
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."is_approved_company_admin"(
  "p_company_id" "uuid", 
  "p_user_id" "uuid" DEFAULT "auth"."uid"()
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    SET "search_path" TO 'public'
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM company_admin_requests 
    WHERE user_id = p_user_id 
    AND company_id = p_company_id
    AND status = 'approved'
  );
$$;
```

#### B.3. `has_developer_access()`
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "public"."has_developer_access"(
  "check_user_id" "uuid" DEFAULT "auth"."uid"()
) RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE "sql" STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
    SET "search_path" TO 'public'
    AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM public.developer_access 
    WHERE user_id = check_user_id
  );
$$;
```

### C. Encryption-Based Isolation Flow

#### C.1. RFX Key Distribution
1. RFX owner creates RFX and generates symmetric key (AES-256-GCM)
2. Symmetric key is encrypted with owner's public key (RSA-OAEP 4096)
3. Encrypted key is stored in `rfx_key_members` table
4. When inviting members, owner decrypts key and re-encrypts with member's public key
5. Members can only access their own encrypted key through RLS
6. Members decrypt key using their private key to access RFX data

#### C.2. Company Key Distribution
1. Company generates RSA key pair (4096 bits)
2. Company public key stored in `company` table
3. Company private key encrypted with master key and stored in `company` table
4. RFX keys encrypted with company public key stored in `rfx_company_keys`
5. Company admins can access company keys through RLS policies
6. Company keys used to decrypt RFX data for company-level access
